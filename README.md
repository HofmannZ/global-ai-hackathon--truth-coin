# Global AI Hackathon 2017 Truth coin

## The challenge
The challenge is to build a model which will make it easier and more efficient to identify what really is fake news and what is not (+ everything in between). Our model should be able to determine a level of credibility, content authenticity, and limit the viral spread of fake content, including fake images.

## Our interpretation
We will narrow down our AI to finding fake news regarding flux in crypto currencies. In particular Bitcoin, this way we have a load of training data.
