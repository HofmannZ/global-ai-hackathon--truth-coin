91,False,1,False,1,7,False,0,False,0,"Hello everyone, <br/><br/>Sorry for the increased tension in the forum. I thrived to create an atmosphere in which everyone respects other&#39;s idea. Many avoided the confrontation to open this passage, I did it for you. And nobody owns this forum alone.  <br/><br/>Now there is an undeniable amount of users who are concerned  about miner decentralization. I am one of those concerned users. As one of commentators rightfully demanded we need solutions rather than complaints. <br/><br/>I will do some brain storming here. So no idea is stupid. &quot;You know nothing&quot; is not an counter-argument. <br/><br/>what can we do against miners centralization?<br/><br/>(1. uasf: This is the nuclear option, better if it would be enough to motivate miners to activate segwit peacefully just like it happened in litecoin. Read charlie lee&#39;s tweets to find out how he used that uasf card successfully. I have wrote a lot about it. I am not going to repeat it. go to my profile and read please.) This became very political. So putting in parenthesis to focus on  other options. <br/><br/>2. When the dust settles, we wont have much issues to fight about possibly in september. but miner centralization is not going anywhere. Then comes BITCOIN HALVING around Jun 20th, 2020. <br/><br/>Bitcoin halving reward 6.25 BTC<br/>Block tx fees total minimum: 3 BTC. <br/><br/>Fees will be 30-50% of miners income! <br/><br/>Not every transaction is urgent, right? Are you waiting for a transaction send between your own wallets to be verified during midnight? Possibly there are  some users (like me) not content with paying a pool whose actions are not plausible, or because they are just too powerful. How about we are given a choice on wallets to blacklist certain miners at the cost of a delay proportionate with the total blacklisted rashrate. For instance if I blacklist antpool, i will see a 18% delay. Anyway I am sleeping at that time. <br/><br/>Tx info will be sent over a dedicated channel so that receiving miner will not propagate that fearing he may be blacklisted as well. Because your wallet will say blacklist worked.  <br/><br/>If enough people does that, that miner can not say &quot;users are nothing&quot;. <br/><br/>And if 50% does that, this will be 15-25% loss for that miner. They can not compensate that easily (even with asicboost) i believe.<br/><br/>Miners will be scared of being in the same photo shot with the blacklisted miner fearing a negative impact on the business. <br/><br/>Please correct me if I am wrong. <br/><br/>This can be a BIP if we can get enough support. Please feel free to criticize.  <br/><br/>Geeks can still do this. But the important thing is bitcoin wallet provides this as a reference and other wallets follows it. <br/><br/>3. This is more futuristic. <br/><br/>Total hashrate: 5 million TH/s. <br/>there are usb miners with 50 GH/s like 21.co.  In the future, if bitcoin gets enough reach, 100 million usb miners would make a 50% share in doubled total. This is an enough action to prevent behind the closed doors meetings. Because excluding 50% hashrate from meeting would make meeting invalid. <br/><br/>Compare this number with the total 7.19 billion mobile phones as of 2014 stats. <br/><br/>This action requires educating new generations about crypto currencies and the need for decentralization. The miners shall either mine in democratic pools or solo mine. Notice the user does not expect a mining income but a collective ideal. <br/><br/>These are my solutions i have in mind. Please feel free to criticize and make corrections. I sensed that there are more well-versed people in bitcoin than me in this forum that can contribute to this discussion. My ideas might be totally stupid or against your ideas.

I am a victim of altcoiner.net and shall do everything possible to stop them. <br/><br/>My experience with Bitcoin investment company: Altcoiner (www.altcoiner.net)<br/><br/>From their homepage, this company looks very serious. Their moto: &quot;AltCoiner – At the forefront of AltCoins Trading&quot; and the ABOUT US is convincing! They offer three investment plans for Bitcoin owners. You deposit a specified amount of Bitcoins for the level and each day, you receive a corresponding interest added to your account. The site is professionally done and can fool normal users. Registration is traightforward. They even advise you to start with very little amount to get used to the system and increase gradually. So, yu feel confident they are not after your hard-earned Bitcoins. So, you open an account for the lowest tier. You deposit a reasonable amount. You get an acknowledgement and the amount is posted in your account. Then, like magic, you see your earnings added to your account. Each deposit cannot be withdrawn before 5 calendar days. Each time you add money to your account, the 5-days start all over again. <br/><br/>There is abolutely no reason to be supsicious. Nothing at all. Everything looks normal. Deposits are acknowledged as soon as they are confirmed by the network. Account is credited with both deposits and interest, so you see your account growing. You think any time, when you need the funds, you&#39;ll claim it and this very honest company will return your Bitcoin with the earned interest.<br/><br/>Here is my experience:<br/><br/>Deposits<br/><br/>10 May: 0.30 BTC<br/>11 May: 0.14 BTC<br/>22 May: 0.90 BTC<br/>22 May: 0.767 BTC<br/><br/>Total: 2.107 BTC<br/><br/>With my amounts deposited (under 3.99 BTC), I fell under level 1 investment. I chose 100% compunded interest, which is offred as option.<br/><br/>On May 30, my principal and interest had amounted to: 3.7483362. I was bout to add more funds to move to the next level, as it did not rrequire much. Before that, I decided to test their withdrawal speed, just in case I needed the money urgently one day.<br/><br/>So, on may 30, I requested a withdrawal of my principal and interest. Alcoiner retained their 5% fees so the amount due to me was: 3.5610119.<br/><br/>From that day, it still shows as pending in my account. However, to date, not an single message from the company. No response to three support tickets. TOTAL SILENCE.<br/><br/>Maybe I have lost this important amount to me. It has alsoo shattered my initial enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, because there really isn&#39;t a way from keeping company like these to operate without any warning to the unawares. as of writing, this company&#39;s website is still there, probably accepting new users and their Bitcoins. Nowhere to go to be warned against such unethical business behavior! Due diligence is not enough. <br/><br/>So, in conclusion, please STAY AWAY from alcoiner.net. Let my experience be a warning to you and do not repeat my mistake. They are very clever, as dishonest people usuall are. Even after this warneing, if you gp to the website and read what they are offering, you may have some doubts. Do not. you have been warned.

The same law applies to BTC as larger percentage moves upward become more difficult. If your question is a trading question, good luck, nobody knows where these two cryptos are headed day to day.

As mentioned in a previous post ascending wedges are bearish and have a low chance of breaking up, Even if they break up they have a good chance of throwbacks. The same is true if they break down. We completed a wedge formation that broke up after a fakeout recently, and the information on these wedges can found in the posts I made there. <br/><br/>We have a BIG wedge from the old ATH to the recent new ATHs - top trendline (resistance - bitfinex draws this back to the ETF rejection rise, and Bistamp draws this back to the recovery in January post PBOC ban Bitcoin). Low trendline is the wick on the big drop, and the dips through out till now (support). Convergence and resolution no later than the 14th. We are also in a smaller ascending wedge, from the drop from the ATH to the 2600 range. So ascending wedge-ception.<br/><br/>This could be a big move up or down. Targets for the big wedge are measured in the distance of the big drop from ATH (partial returns). Resolution of the smaller ascending wedge does not garantee resolution of the other in the same direction.<br/><br/>So... bearish chances, but lots of variance involved.

I pointed out that ETH would rise to $100, that LTC was undervalued at $4, and that bitcoin transaction fees would likely be at $50 by the end of the year. Today, I&#39;m sorry to announce that the last of those warnings is likely to come true this week: we paid $37.32 for a single transaction this morning. As a result, we increased our bitcoin payout threshold to $250, at a time when the threshold for all other coins remains at $1. These payout transactions cost less than 50 cents at the beginning of the year.<br/><br/>Another warning that received substantial criticism back in 2014 was my prediction that the next bubble would be popped by the transaction limit. It is now difficult to see a world in which this prediction doesn&#39;t come true. Bitcoin is a broken, unusable, unaffordable network, and people are leaving it in droves. About 98% of our desired transactions are suppressed; if the space were there, we would expand our usage over 25 times (and end up paying even more fees in the end).<br/><br/>That&#39;s why I now believe it is more likely than not that Ethereum will become the #1 market-capitalized cryptocurrency before August 5. There is a large disconnect between the truth on the ground and what people believe.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I do not believe that ETH will follow the same bubble cycle as Bitcoin did, and as many people believe it will. ETH is in a fundamentally different position than Bitcoin was. Bitcoin had its first few bubbles, especially the two in 2013, for its potential rather than actual usage. Until now, there was little actual usage of cryptocurrencies, resulting in &quot;potential&quot; bubbles",https://images.cryptocompare.com/50250/395e3b4c-7f9d-4680-80ef-9e47fd15a2fc.png,50250,dallycurtis,False,54619,False,False,1182,2017-06-07 15:02:14.167

381,False,13,False,8,14,False,0,False,0,"Woke up a little early. Guess it is the adrenline from the price jump that is messing with my sleep. Been looking around for a damage report. Here are some numbers and musings.<br/><br/>The contract position I posted yesterday was a liquiduation of a the size of 13 million USD. In ONE account! That was a short position.<br/>#1 Top holder on OKex (same exchange) lost about 1,5 million USD last night.<br/>#2 Top holder on OKex lost about 650,000 USD last night.<br/>1K margin shorts on Bitfinex escaped before the price jump. 4K did not. That is a lot of wrecked trading accounts.<br/><br/>Similar positions have been eliminated on Bitmex futures.<br/><br/>These are not random degenerate gambler positions, at least not all of them. The top traders on OKex are JUST THAT, top traders. The best on the exchange, measured over a long time period. Most of them probably enjoy some level of information access, that we plebs do not have.<br/><br/>Top trading advice is to never short a bull run. So what are they all doing? I think I know. It wasn&#39;t dumb, it was just wrong timing, and this was a deliberate attack on short positions. Why do I say this was a deliberate attack? Look at Cryptomarket cap numbers. Select 1 day range:<br/><br/>https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/<br/><br/>See that drop in alt market cap? It comes JUST before total market cap (that is bitcoin, since alt went down) explodes, then wobbles. About 4 Billion USD in market cap moved IN/OUT/IN/OUT in the space of 2 hours. That is not BTC - ALT and back, it is BTC - FIAT - BTC -FIAT - BTC. That sh!t is crazy... Steriod level straight jacket insane, and there is no way this can be called &quot;difference in opinion about BTC value&quot;. This was a correct observation, that the market was OVER-LEVERAGED, and that was exploited massively for profit.<br/><br/>What is over-leverage? It is when margin positions are way out of any reasonable expectation of a return on the position they have taken. How do we know this was the case?<br/><br/>Example from before the crash: <br/>Bitfinex lending rates hit 0,4% a DAY... this means a loan taken out to go margin long at say 2400 USD, expects the following:<br/>((1+rate) lifted up to 365 days) - 1 = approx 330% price appreciation over one year for BTC, just to BREAK EVEN! That means that if BTC in one year of this position is at 8K, the holder of this position is BREAKING EVEN - that is NOT seeing profits! Clearly, at this point, just buying BTC cash on spot is a better option, unless you are targeting much larger price appreciation.<br/><br/>I like BTC too, but that sh!t is crazy... it is far beyond what is realistic. And others have probably spotted this as well, hence the large interest in going short on those expectations.<br/><br/>During the recovery rates have dropped a bit to about 0.2% daily. That is still a 108% annual appreciation target to break even. Thus a position at 2400 USD on the run up here, requires 4800 USD coins within a year trajectory to break even. You must assume these longs want to see profit, so in reality, the price appreciation must be on a much steeper slope, or they will lose money even with price going up! These loans are 30 day MAX periods.<br/><br/>We don&#39;t know how long these funds have been reserved for, but they have to see SHARP appreciation on the short term to even be viable.<br/><br/>The problem here is that we now have destroyed the short positions on Bitfinex. There is a now 7K margin longs that are NOT covered by margin shorts, should they decide to take profit. And they have to take profit within 30 days. That is if those positions are all assumed to be fresh from today (which they are not). Those shorts are not coming back any time soon after this burn... which means, if those longs are NOT covered by fresh money injections within the next 30 days, BTC price cannot even remain flat. And Bitfinex cannot let new money IN! Other exchanges can, and price can go up there, but NOT on Bitfinex which is market USD leader!<br/><br/>Spotting the short opportunity was the right call, and it was deliberately wrecked once it was set up! That is what I mean by this being a deliberate attack. That money that saved the longs is allied with the longs in some sense, so they are NOT willing to pay their profits. It has to be fresh cash injections of 675.000 USD a DAY just to remain at this price point (bitfinex calculations, not covering the whole market).<br/><br/>What we do not know at this point, but I am sure many of the shorters knew, is what other leveraged markets are doing. We can see Bitmex, but we cannot see the whale exclusive margin trading on GDax, and the prime customer exclusive margin trading BETA testing programme on Bitstamp. But I am sure many of these wrecked shorters could, and that the picture was similar to Bitfinex, but maybe not quite as insane. If anyone has access to these markets, I would like to know about the funding rates!<br/><br/>But in short (sorry for the pun), either we get LOTS of new money injections, EVERY DAY for the next month on ALL exchanges, that want to buy BTC for holding, NOT alt trading, then correction is inevitable. All it takes is for a sizeable chunk of margin longs to take profit, and not be covered by new longs, and the existing pool will see a substantial price appreciation go into loss because of the funding rate they are paying every single day.<br/><br/>Make your bets gentlemen... we need LOTS and LOTS of new cash just to stay floating, to say nothing of appreciation, on an exchange, that is market USD leader, that cannot get new cash.<br/><br/>What will happen? Will the other exchanges have healthier funding markets and long/short positions? Or will Bitfinex crash, and the other exchanges do what they did at the low of the dump, namely refuse to correct to it, and dethrone Bitfinex (and polo with it since they run in tandem) for good?<br/><br/>I dunno... I really don&#39;t. But I can see why newworldchaos would put all in fiat. In fact, despite the price jump and BTC moving UP while I slept, I am tempted to IGNORE dips and stay in fiat too. And I am not touching a SINGLE alt!<br/><br/>Good luck to all of you traders/hodlers and so on.... I don&#39;t know where this ends. If the hype cycle is strong enough, this can still go 5K before UASF becomes a serious issue. We could stay flat. We could crash, and yes to 1250 or lower.... I don&#39;t know.

Over the past few years, we have received frequent requests to launch a variety of digital assets on our exchange. Our stance, as a sophisticated digital asset trading platform that serves millions of users around the world, has always been to be prudent about adding new digital assets that have not been fully tested by the market. <br/><br/>Recently, OKCoin users have taken interest in the development of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), and there is an increasing demand for OKCoin to enable ETH and ETC trading. For the past two years, we have been constantly reviewing the viability of listing ETH and ETC based on factors including technical maturity, innovation, market liquidity, and compliance. <br/><br/>Today, we are formally launching ETH on the OKCoin exchange. Ethereum has a current circulation of 90 million, with ETH reaching a market cap in excess of USD 10 billion, and a total hashrate of more than 25K GB. Hundreds of applications are now built on Ethereum and a growing number of applications are using smart contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain. <br/><br/>More than 20 top global financial institutions and technology companies, including JPMorgan Chase, CME Group, BNY Mellon, Thomson Reuters, Microsoft, Intel, and Accenture, have set up the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) to define enterprise-grade applications of Ethereum. China&#39;s Tencent, Zhong An Insurance and other well-known companies are also investigating various applications of blockchain. The United Nations has just launched its first large-scale Ethereum test to distribute humanitarian funds. <br/><br/>Given this opportunity, we implore BTC Core developers and relevant Miners to work together and resolve any outstanding technical issues, activate Segwit, and solve BTC’s scaling issues. Our industry and the history of technology offers us many warnings, whether it’s the IE browser or the Nokia mobile phone. No matter how dominant, how much market share you have, if you do not adopt the latest technology and fail to constantly improve on the core user value proposition, time will pass you by. Ultimately, digital asset exchanges around the world can only advocate for the best technology and aim to provide the best trading experience for our clients. <br/><br/>OKCoin will officially enable Ethereum (ETH) deposit and withdrawal services on 22:00, May 31. ETH trading services will be officially available on 12:00, June 1. <br/><br/>We pride ourselves on excellent product and quality customer service.

Because Bitfinex is the only exchange that is producing an independant chart, and it can be read with certainty. The other exchanges are in some way conforming to Bitfinex and to some extent converging to reduce the price gap... which makes their charts harder to read, and also hard to trade, because you risk a random 70-80 USD drop and misrepresentative indicators (Polo is doing alt-trader variation but conforms to Bitfinex too)...

I got it at a mix of 1,115-1,12, compared to the complete fantasy of 1.18 Bitstamp produced just a few days ago. When USD/€ moves like this, it affects the pairs. So with low liquidity on €, you have the option of stopping out in USD, or doing it in € and taking the hit of price. Both can be really bad, for different reasons (such as doing 6% gains on a trade, only to be stopped out on a similar 6% USD/€ local switch, and fees on top, with spread and slippage, leading to loss on a solid trade). So I am awaiting an opening with a favourable €/USD ratio. In any case, my profits are protected now even if I lost flexibility.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is a clear channel up on Bitfinex.

No one spoke as we watched it happen.<br/><br/>It was an OH Shit moment, as the TV monitors flashed data, pictures, real time cruise missile launches, B-52, B-1 and other attacks could be watched, in real time.  While satellite real time video showed what was to be a bad day for some poor Iraqi guy with a wife and kids back home who did not want to be there in the first place.<br/><br/>Like @dallycurtis watching Braveheart I cried.

The wall just destroyed the Green team and sent the price back over a $1.00.  Still, they come.  Disillusioned, doubting, fearful.<br/><br/>On 31 May, 153 years ago, the Battle of Cold Harbor was fought. Grant said of the battle in his memoirs, &quot;I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made. ... No advantage whatever was gained to compensate for the heavy loss we sustained.&quot;  Grant was not an educated man and I doubt he read the Art of War.<br/><br/>At this time, I invite you to invoke the AOW tactical disposition of defense:  <br/><br/>“The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.  Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; “<br/><br/>The Red team will defeat those who sell or buy aimlessly, shooting their arrows into the abyss, hoping to strike some target, while depleting their resources.  <br/><br/>If there is nothing to sell, and the price drops, they will have no reason to lose money, and slow down.<br/><br/>Also, there is no reason to buy while the fighting is going on. The battlefield is unstable.  What looked good 3 days ago is now an unacceptable position.<br/><br/>“The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth”.<br/>“Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to  defeat first fights, and afterwards looks for victory.”<br/><br/>The Finns used this tactic during the Winter War.  They, in essence lost battles, but won the war.  White Death had a 0-259 kill ratio.  They became invisible when weak, fought only when they could win.  <br/><br/>Crypto is economic war. <br/><br/>So, what to do?<br/><br/>As a group, the CC cryptos can, if you so choose, to not buy any more Crypto spontaneously.  As a group, you can choose not to sell any.<br/>  <br/>I do not know how many of you are out there, nor do I care.  We constitute a block of influence and can choose to do whatever we want.<br/><br/>What we can do is together, allow for a cooling off time, let the other teams fight the dragon while we, collect our FIAT, and get ready for a big buy, at the right time.<br/><br/>Increase our intelligence levels.  Lots of really talented people out there who can provide intel and suggestions.<br/><br/>I do not understand how 75K of sales can go in one block when I have limited allowances per week.

Thank You cryptocompare.com<br/>What I try to share is this BTC has make my life easy... Eg: Xapo allow me to get Xapo Bitcoin Debit Card similar to Spectrocoin. I can apply for Debit Card in USD , Pound and Euro.<br/>I do a lot of travelling and spend lot of expenses oversea. Even I have business relationship with company in United Stated. <br/>The benefit of using Xapo Debit Debit Card for payment really make my life easier since the debit card is with Visa or Master similar to bank issue card.<br/>1. Whenever I go I easily swipe the card for all my oversea expenses and immediately know the balance of my BTC. No need for me to exchange fiat money at money changer.<br/>2. I can withdraw cash anywhere I go via ATM machine and no need for me to change lot currency before my  travelling.<br/>3. My supplier oversea also accept payment through debit card with unlimited amount. This save my time to do wire transfer oversea and being question by my govt for money out from my country.<br/>4. Xapo wallet also allow me to create Fiat Currency wallet and if the crash like this I move my BTC to USD easily and move back to BTC when its recover.<br/>5. I also have invested in various Alt Coin eg ETH, LTC, Ripple, Doge, Humaniq, and another one is new ICO. I&#39;m bit lucky cause come to place the money at the price when it not so high like this. The most important thing is I have recover my initial investment because my investment value has multiple a lot since last year.<br/><br/>As a  summary, I feel that Bitcoin and when it link to real life it make my life easier especially when dealing with oversea transactions. It is not just for the sake of investment per say for me. When this come with added value for my life then I think it will also help others like me.

I get that part.  BTC was first kid on the block - so massive starter advantage - very popular - this goes a long way as everyone knows.<br/><br/>And I see how privacy would help some of the other coins (Dash, Monero, ZCash, more?...) as drug dealers and arms dealers queue up to hide their cash (I judge nobody). <br/><br/>I can also see how for example Ethereum or RIPPLE could help save shed loads of cash for banks or as smart contracts between individual companies or users - the developers get paid to make these things work so fair play.  But how does that smart crypto fruit actually benefit a holder of the coins?  If I don&#39;t plan to send of receive interbank money, why own XRP? (if the banks even choose to use it anyway).  Is it simply in the hopes that companies and people around the world will want it?  <br/><br/>Which brings me on to the coins that are hoping to replace the money supply - near instant point of sale payments for a coffee is probably possible in the not too distant future.  And I agree if people could do that then the demand for that money supply would be huge.  BUT - do you think any developed big country government is going to allow its citizens to just abandon the countries currency in favour of something that would allow people to avoid taxes?  What do you think pays for all the Business Welfare State? And the wars?<br/><br/>I can see the governments allowing crypto in the beginning to better understand how people might get to know it, but then, there will almost certainly be coins emerging from the bigger countries, possibly based on the established guys now - that allow some measure of limited control over it. Otherwise governments might as well pack up and go home, because no tax = no government.  <br/><br/>And finally, while I&#39;m on a roll, let&#39;s say the UK government AGREED to use, say, DASH coin technology to create their own coin - how does that benefit the current holders of DASH.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re still reading, thanks for persevering.

546,False,1,False,2,8,False,2,False,1,"Theory on Bitcoin Manipulation based on facts obtained first hand. <br/><br/>Lets not fool ourselves this massive btc drop off happened right as many first time buyers with deep pockets came into play from all over the world, very strategic timing. So what just happened in with BTC? Its hard to understand at first but what actually took place resulted in  a direct siphon of money to china as their fiat dollar continues to fall. Hmmmm?<br/><br/>Why would I make such claims?<br/>The Chinese already have a monopoly with BTC mining, one would be foolish to think otherwise.<br/>In my mind its nearly certain Bitmain the people who run the largest BTC pool, and the only manufacture of the fastest most efficient asic miner. Bitmain well understands this part of mining better than anyone.  This is why you havent seen antpools has hashrate to double that of the 2nd place pool. and would influence the market to maximize there profit margin. So if this is the case  a number near 50 percent of all new bitminers / newly minted btc would  stay within china.  People need to understand that the flow of newly generated coins into the market is the key. Bitmain is so sure of the rising value it recently stopped accepting USD wire-transfers and is only accepting bitcoin as payment from now on. This recent bubble wouldn&#39;t have been as big or as noticeable &quot;yet&quot; had BU been adopted by the majority community.  A backed up network drives the tx transaction rate up allowing for bitcoin txs to be worth as much as 6-8 bitcoin extra ontop of the 12.5 btc block reward. Since the system was already  backing up they decide to manipulate further ( more on this later) for those panic sellers who need the transactions confirmed asap they would be wiling to pay the highest rates to the miners to confirm their txs first... thus giving Bitmain and the large chinese miners the biggest block reward ive seen under current block size.<br/><br/> Without more time to wait for they initiated there massive sell of new bitcoin and which was at a  time when bitcoin was at new all time high and a the most unconfirmed tickets i have ever seen.. No wonder that all the big chinese btc pool are mining profit with BU and would have stood to profit even more. These manipulations are not as visible, until the network is back logged. Chinese miners waited for all the right things and manipulate the market when btc was at a all time highe.  all they did was wait for for a new difficulty rise coming in a few days with the massive bubble they actually helped pump up. A  massive uptick in new bigmoney investments was the last thing they needed. Bitmain manipulated the market but cutting off a huge percent of newly minted btc. This scarcity created false demand by not only holding the coin, but actually turning off miners. to help the networks transactions back up. <br/><br/>Also know over the past month there was a masssive loss of BTCs hashing power  massive amounts of miners were turned off the to back up the TX transactions, thus resulting in a spike in the amount of money MINERS were making due to a heavily congested network. These people have been dealing with it the longest. <br/><br/>Right as bitcoin was growing at an even faster rate, BOOM the massive influx of new BTC into the system created too much supply and  Immediately sent  BTC  in a downward spiral. As the downturn started the networks hashrate hits a new all time high, with the massive inflation of tx fees from the planned hasrate reduction, and now Bitmain stands to make even more moeny through the high transaction fees. The lack of newly minted bitcoin caused or largely influenced this bubble.. And what would one do with all this bitcoin, sell it at the most opportune time when the exchange rate is at an all time high.  All those newly minted bitcoin dropping into the the market Caused panic  Now the Market drops the Chinese fiat grows massively against BTC. So now their currency in less then  2 days can buy heir paper currency. They buy back in when they have the highest conversion rate to their currency. DONE  They made money on both the selling bitcoin and the downturn and repurchase. All caused by selling so many freshly minted/never before traded bitcoin into a market that has been going up on false scarcity.<br/><br/>Also know over the past month there was a masssive loss of BTCs hashing power  massive amounts of miners were turned off the to back up the TX transactions, thus resulting in a spike in the amount of money MINERS were making due to a heavily congested network. These people have been dealing with it the longest and knew exactly how to manipulate it to benefit them the most.  More transaction clogging the network the higher the rate anyone is willing to pay to have their transaction a priority.<br/><br/>Summary<br/> The size of this bubble was also directly influenced by big Chinese miners collaborating in a number of ways to profit the most off their dying currency and bitcoin.<br/>bitcoins network hashing rate fell...  over 500P/h  for a brief period directly coinciding with a difficulty increase. <br/>Those 500P/h still account for over 10 percent of the entire networks rate . <br/>Fast forward  the difficulty rose they they put there plan into action massive new bitcoin sales hit... so everyone else mining actually takes a difficulty spike alongside the with the 10% hashrate spike on the network and the downward spiral that ensued.  All of which I believe was  planned perfectly, end eventually caused the misfortune of many holding BTC . <br/> This was done so bitmain  would profit the most and stay supreme as the top dog mining.  <br/>Massive amounts of miners were turned back on in a very short time on  a heavily congested network overpriced  tx fees. These people have been dealing with Bitcoin buying and trading the longest, which is  why I am certain they manipulated it the networks mining fees, and either manipulated price of bitcoin though good old supply and demand, or worse they were the cause of the bubble itself.<br/><br/>Also know over the past month there was a masssive loss of BTCs hashing power  massive amounts of miners were turned off the to back up the TX transactions, thus resulting in a spike in the amount of money MINERS were making due to a heavily congested network. These people have been dealing with it the longest. <br/><br/>other food for thought<br/>The Chinese Pools were not the only ones to benift still those stoies are the rare ones.

It is now live and hopefully bug-free?:) (Sorry about the small downtime... I managed to push a few bugs with my first try)<br/><br/>I also added a lot of hover info and added a 1 week period on the portfolio chart.<br/><br/>For example, if you hover over the top stats you get the full numbers.<br/>If you hover over the Total Value next to each coin in the portfolio you get your total investment value. Same works for the collapsed view.<br/><br/>Now the exciting bit, the collapsed view. It combines all your open positions and averages the entry price. If you bought in different currencies it just averages the entry price in the portfolio currency. The amount is the sum of all the coins you have and the price next to it is the weighted average entry position. The price is the current price of the Coin - Portfolio currency pair. The total is the total current worth of all your open positions in the coin. If you hover over the total, you see the total investment. The profit is the sum of all profits and the % change is the profit/investment * 100.<br/><br/>I have also done some optimizations and bug fixes around the data loading. You should now see the value of the portfolio straight away and not a few ms after the loading screen disappears. <br/><br/>If you hover over the total open positions (just under the coin name) you will get a list of buy dates. On the sold side, you get a list of sold dates. I&#39;ve also put on the small pct change next to the current price a small title to explain it&#39;s the 24h % change (we had a few questions about it).<br/><br/>For now, I have disabled editing and selling in the collapsed view until I come up with some sort of interface to ask you which position you want to sell or edit. Another option would be to sell automatically a bit of each but not sure if that is intended behavior. You could have some BTC in a wallet, one on an exchange, one on another and maybe some more in a different wallet.... you need to know which one you are selling.<br/><br/>I&#39;ll get Kanopt (aka Antonio) to do a guide that explains how all of this works and in the next update, I&#39;ll try to find a clever way to link to guides for each section of the portfolio.<br/><br/>As always, let me know in the comments here if you find any bugs or if I broke anything else (might be the case as I&#39;ve spent the last 20 hours working on it - not complaining as the price was going up so I would have probably looked at it anyway).<br/><br/>https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/1383280/portfolio-collapsed.png",https://images.cryptocompare.com/3831/295b2e24-f19a-442c-ab4d-efd94731040d.png,3831,ZeroCool86,False,42664,False,False,1182,2017-05-21 22:01:43.363

This is not a commentary or endorsement of him, just an invitation for you to consider, below.<br/><br/>During the 2016 Presidential campaign, everyone was talking about &quot;I am with Her&quot; and &quot;the Donald&quot;.  I listened to them and noticed that no one mentioned Bernie Sanders.  So, I decided to take my own poll.  I asked over 1000 people if they heard of Bernie Sanders.<br/> Although what I did, can be considered an “Antidotal”, non-scientific poll,  the results were astounding.  9 out of 10 people said, “Bernie Sanders”?.  Who is he?<br/><br/>It was easy to conclude that the MSM were ignoring him, as they are with CryptoCurrencies.  The establishment just does not want to let anyone to know that there is an alternative to Dead Money savings accounts, loss of Savings at 2% = 50% reduction in value @ 10 years etc. Stock market is fraudulent…… and your government prints money without any backing, every day.<br/><br/>I took my own poll, asking everyone I met, over the last 30 days, amounting to over 500 people, if they heard about Bitcoin.  Again, the results are astounding.  85% said “Bitcoin, what is that?”.  Out of the 15% who said yes, I asked what do you know about it, they all said either, “drug dealers use it”, or that is was “an unstable Ponzi scheme”.  No one owned a Bitcoin, nor did they intend to.<br/><br/>My point is this:  Crypto cannot succeed without us implementing the Hundreth monkey effect.  We must train and educate enough people for the Crypto Coin effect to take off now, not by 2030.  <br/><br/>What to do:<br/>1.	People are not aware of Crypto.  Why, data not &quot;pushed&quot; via establishment propaganda channels.<br/>2.	We need more investors in Crypto, not just a fringe group due to the limited funds of the few that are in Crypto vs the population sitting on trillions in Dead Money savings accounts.<br/>3.	We must educate as many people as possible about Crypto, and turn them into investors or what ever terminology you want to use to describe them.<br/><br/>How to do?:  Tell everyone.  Many of you are already doing that.  Kudo’s.  Lurkers need to get active.  <br/><br/>Example:  4K of Cryptonites X 1 person a week X 52 weeks = 208K more investors.  Tell them to go to<br/> https://www.cryptocompare.com and educate them. <br/><br/>The growth potential from just 4K investors to 208K is a 5200% increase in one year.

826,False,0,False,0,5,False,0,False,0,"Another Go For The Bitcoin ETF<br/>A lot of people are surprised to learn the SEC is not fully giving up on the concept of a bitcoin ETF just yet. Although the BATS rule change proposal was rejected in march of 2017. The institution will take a second look at the proposal. This is thanks to the Bats BZX exchange team filing a petition for a ruling review, which has now been approved by the SEC. That is quite interesting, as the SEC could easily reject this petition as well.<br/><br/>Now that the petition has been approved, the SEC is looking for further comments on the Bats rule change proposal. Any input is welcome until May 15th. It is doubtful the SEC will suddenly approve the rule proposal change, though, but this goes to show the idea of a major publicly traded bitcoin ETF is not out of the question just yet. Moreover, this news may have a positive effect on the bitcoin price as well, even though a second rejection will probably send it crashing hard, just like it did in March.<br/><br/>The Winklevoss twins are quite excited about the news, although they are not getting their hopes up just yet. One has to be realistic about the chance of the SEC suddenly approving the Bats rule change proposal, which still remains slim to none. At the time of the rejection, the SEC referred to the lack of market surveillance and regulation, which makes bitcoin an asset that does not qualify for the standards to be part of a publicly traded ETF.<br/><br/>Very little has changed ever since that time, though, making it virtually impossible to see the SEC suddenly approve the Bats proposal. While it is good the organization has approved the review of the rejection, there is no reason to think things will play out any differently in the coming weeks. There will be a lot of hope surrounding the review process, while the end result will most likely be the same yet again.

841,False,3,False,0,0,False,1,False,0,"I invite all forum readers to read this post.  <br/>Everyone is wondering about what is going to happen next.  The future of Cryptocurrencies is dependent on many factors.  So, let’s just list a few, and I will depend on all of you to suggest additional factors.  <br/>The purpose of this exercise is to convey, to everyone, the futility of accurate predictions, based on scientific principles, not lemming appealing “opinions”.  People ask me all the time what my opinion is of something and my answer is, I have no opinion, just data.<br/>Here are some of the factors we, the Crypto community needs to consider:<br/>1.	 What countries are attempting to stop or are attempting to use Crypto?  What impact does each country have, positive or negative to this equation? Example Russia Vs. China Vs. Mexico.  What impact weight do we give each country?<br/>2.	What NGOs are attempting to stop or are attempting to use Crypto?  What impact does each NGO have, positive or negative to this equation?  What impact weight do we give each NGO?<br/>3.	What Banking systems are attempting to stop or are attempting to use Crypto?  What impact does each system have, positive or negative to this equation?  USAA Vs. Citi.<br/>4.	What Stealth Financial organizations such as the Federal Reserve and Reserve banks, the Rothschild influences, Winklevoss initiatives etc., in other countries are attempting to stop or are attempting to use Crypto?  What impact does each entity have, positive or negative to this equation?<br/>5.	Impact of inflation, recession, depression, debt load, political disruptions, wars have, for each country in the world, have on this equation?<br/>6.	The true value of Fiat currency not backed by gold or anything else, and the constant printing of money by almost all countries Vs. the limited number of Crypto coins produced Vs. the fiat used to buy these coins.<br/>7.	The economic impact of transfer of the value of the “dead cash” in institutional savings accounts into Crypto.<br/>8.	The administration of Crypto done by mathematical geniuses (thanks Vitalik Buterin and others) who are not business people, who need to consider, cost benefit ratios of mining, administration, the obscene cost of transactions by traders, etc.,….. to reduce non-value added parasitic losses to Crypto owners.<br/>9.	Regulatory or Nonregulatory policies in each country and bank that imposes either limitations, taxes, or restrictions on Crypto flow, into and out of Fiat monies.  <br/>10.	Infrastructure stability to insure mining, administration, internet, etc, is available to meet the demand.<br/><br/>Here are just 10 issues not addressed by the community, blogs, most self-described Crypto “Guru’s on YouTube, Crypto web sites, and the world in general.  There are many more, and I will spare you the pain.  These are the issues I think about and you are asking about.  No real answers tho……<br/><br/>Reporting that Crypto has reached a new high Market Cap or is now at $1876 per X-coin is not an analysis.  An analysis is to take the data and formulate it into a cogent direction in which everyone can understand.  Use the Occam’s razor example.  The simplest answer is the best.  Simply stating that BTX, for example is going to be $500,000 per coin, without analytical substance or explanation is click bait bullshit that helps no one to make a proper decision.  I remember everyone was using $2000 by September…We are now $200 dollars from that level and September is 133 days away.  <br/><br/>If each issue has 10 variables, times the 10 issues, the realm of possibilities is 10 to the 10th power.  That gives us 10 billion possibilities as to the future of Crypto.  <br/><br/>Which possibility do you chose? <br/><br/>Now, while we are at it, let’s give a big thanks to the guys and gals, who run this web site.

Overall, market cap is growing which shows that people are not getting out so much as just shifting their money around like lemmings following other really stupid lemmings. That just gives the exchanges a lot more money in their pocket due to obscene charges, volatility of the market, and provokes the &quot;fear&quot; holders of Crypto to sell and hide somewhere else. This is beyond idiocracy. &quot;Need more electrolytes man......&quot; Like what exactly does it really cost to process a transaction? Check it out. Miners fees and transaction fees are the bane of Crypto. Do Segwit now. Listen to the Russian kid. He has got some brains for sure... <br/><br/>Also, the exchanges are not yet properly equipped to handle all this volume. Kraken and Coinbase are good examples of poor IT management in which they are incapable of handling all this volume. I do not buy the denial of service excuses. They were failing way before the alleged DOS occurred. Their systems are not even synchronized as they all show massive divergent in pricing and value. They need to fire their IT idiots just like the fearless orange leader fired some other people that worked for him because they did not do their jobs. No one who provides any real Crypto analysis dares criticize the &quot;Exchanges&quot; for fear that they will lose their coins. Most &quot;analysis&quot; posts on our esteemed Crypto web sites are fluff jobs done by high school equivalent &quot;journalists&quot;. No facts, no real analysis, just friggin charts that make no sense to anyone to include people who actually have 4 college degrees. Total paska. W/o no explanation as to how someone comes up with an analysis, it is worthless. Just noise. <br/><br/>This is exactly why previous posts saying &quot;DIVERSIFY&quot; are valid.

This is not only an investment in getting rid of the banks that give you 0% interest on your cash in the bank, but charge you 21% for your credit card debt. This is about making a statement, enough is enough. <br/><br/>Crypto is yours. Own it. They only want to ruin it. Buy......buy... buy... <br/><br/>Have no fear.<br/><br/>P.S.

A link to the full study can be found at the bottom of this page. Seems to be only the beginning.<br/><br/>The current number of unique active users of cryptocurrency wallets is estimated to be between 2.9 million and 5.8 million.<br/>The (cryptocurrency) exchange sector has the highest number of operating entities and employs more people than any other industry sector covered in the study.<br/><br/>Between 5.8 million and 11.5 million (cryptocurrency) wallets are estimated to be currently ‘active’.<br/><br/>While 79% of payment companies have existing relationships with banking institutions and payment networks, the difficulty of obtaining and maintaining these relationships is cited as this sector’s biggest challenge.<br/><br/>70% of large miners rate their influence on crypto industry protocol development as high or very high, compared to 51% of small miners.<br/><br/>The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased more than 3x since early 2016, reaching nearly $25 billion in March 2017.<br/><br/>Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as DASH and Monero (XMR) have become increasingly popular and currently constitute a combined 4 percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.<br/><br/>Market prices of DASH, Monero (XMR) and Ether (ETH) have experienced the most significant growth since June 2016.<br/>A 2016 joint report from Coinbase and ARK Invest estimates that 54 percent of Coinbase users use bitcoin strictly as an investment.<br/><br/>In terms of security, 92 percent of exchanges use cold-storage systems; on average 87 percent of funds are kept in cold storage.  Mult-signature architecture is supported by 86 percent of large exchanges and 76 percent of small exchanges.<br/><br/>http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf",https://images.cryptocompare.com/56802/2b7fec3f-4655-4736-94ff-7cd23a6acfbf.jpg,56802,pbrobanana,False,34080,False,False,1182,2017-05-04 22:39:54.940

The deposit wave stops, because price stabilized around fundamental value and began to climb up again. Then you get another deposit wave from the 24th, in tandem with the second sell off wave,  to the 26nd, presumably because there was some worry as if there would be a third leg down.<br/><br/>Then things become interesting. The first report of USD withdrawal rejection comes around the 23rd/24th. Since the 27th, there has been a constant withdrawal of BTC from Bitfinex in TANDEM with price rising. If you inspect total transactions on the chain, then you can see, that this is happening when the amount of transactions total for BTC are going DOWN and are actually at a really LOW level. So while the rest of the network is not moving coins, people on Bitfinex ARE! The more coins they move OFF the exchange, the more price rises for BTC!<br/><br/>Since Bitfinex is market leader for USD, then price rises on all exchanges, even though no one knows why, and to many people&#39;s amazement, this happens without any serious pullback. We have one of the strongest and quickest rallies in BTC history, right after the 5th most serious tumble in BTC history.... and no one knows why.<br/><br/>Now we know. It was people that could not get USD out of Bitfinex. And since nobody really knew this was the reason for the rally, everyone jumped in, even though we should have had a least a couple of weeks bear or sideways.<br/><br/>As I said all along this rally, fundamental price is below 1000 USD. Speculation outlook is not positive. There is no reason for BTC to be above 1050 max. But we are.

1175,False,10,False,1,7,False,0,False,0,"So if you are confused about the latest development in the Core/BU conflict, and why it lead to a price jump, here is the jist of what is going on.<br/><br/>Maxwell from core posted that a certain manipulation of Proof of Work was built into a certain mining hardware, and this is covert to the rest of the network and community. Hence those that own that hardware factory and have a private mining pool are enjoying a substantial boost in mining profits compared to all other miners. Segwit would block that (actually a lot of protocol changes would block it), thus the &quot;inexplicable&quot; resistance to Cores roadmap from &quot;certain parties&quot;.<br/><br/>Debate exploded all over the community. The allegation is of course thinly veiled. Jihan has been cheating with the asics his company makes, and has held that advantage to himself and his pool alone. Thus he is against Core for centralized monopoly profit, and BU is a filibuster, and his allies are tools that are being screwed by their leader.<br/><br/>The trail of proof is documented here, in the following tweet, which is also commented on by the patent holder of the method:<br/><br/>https://twitter.com/AaronvanW/status/849751522472861696<br/><br/>As you can see, there are some problems with the claim. The first problem is the fact, that the method is patented and is not on Jihan&#39;s hands. But not to worry, there are posts out there, that show that Jihan has a patent submitted for China for something similar. Since that would probably cover China and defy the original patent there, then we are on track right?<br/><br/>IMHO, NO.... not at all.<br/><br/>The first problem that I see with this story is the documetation. As can be seen from the tweet trail, it involves reverse engineering an ASIC from said company. There are problems in this. First, that ASIC had to be procured long before the drop mid March to be investigated. This means when Core blow the alarm that led to the crash to 888 USD, they had this hardware and it was already submitted to re-engineering, and they probably already had the results. Why do I say this? Well, the newest BIP has code in it to reveal covert ASIC BOOST if used. Hence it does not block it, it just shows if the miner is using said covert boosting. Thus could NOT have been done in 2-3 weeks. It is simply impossible. Which means, this &quot;reveal&quot; was PLANNED by Core well BEFORE the crash!<br/><br/>Also worthy of note, Maxwell never presents the report of this retro-engineering, nor independant research that confirms the findings. He also DOES NOT mention Bitmain nor Jihan. The reader is left to guess... which I read as Maxwell not being willing to put lawyers and lawsuits where his mouth is. Which he should given the fact that analysis of the digital trail of the 40.000 anonymous challenge to Ver to put his money where his mouth was (in a very unfair challenge if you understand the math), showed that it was HIM that made that challenge. Furthermore, it was not more than a few days ago, that Core began to rattle the sword about changing the rules of POW to lock out certain ASICS, which sent BitFury into the red zone threatening lawsuits. Of course, it was preparation for this and targetting BitMain, which they just won&#39;t say open, but which everyone infers.<br/><br/>There are two more things that I find very weird about this narrative. Jihan signed off on the Hong Kong agreement. That would have given Segwit in mere months. He did NOT abandon this agreement, Core did when they said none of those they had sent to negotiate and sign could represent Core. So Jihan deliberately based his production of ASICS and his mining pool on a secret advantage, that he wanted to keep for himself for as long as possible, and then signs an agreement to throw all that AWAY in months, and does not break that agreement? That does not make sense!<br/><br/>Furthermore, if his hardware gives every miner 20-30% more hashrate with the activation of a switch, then why hasn&#39;t all the mining pools that support BU activated it and sent the HF in motion? It certainly could push the support over 51% Jihan has this but doesn&#39;t use it... of course.<br/><br/>And lastly, this is being sold as NEWS.... which it ISN&#39;T! Core threatened to HARDFORK over it a year ago! This is OLD NEWS!!!<br/><br/>https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-core-threatens-hard-fork-asicboost-mining-optimization/<br/><br/>Since Core threatened to Hardfork over it, then they have known for over a year, that THIS is not news. They KNOW that the method is old, that they didn&#39;t patch it, because it is debateble if it is a cheat at ALL, even though it is now being labelled as &quot;an exploit&quot; and &quot;an attack on the blockchain&quot;.<br/><br/>I will say this.... THIS is a preplanned media attack. There is no way Core didn&#39;t know they would throw this spin out into the community AFTER they triggered the crash. And the community is eating it up like chowder. Because Core have understood one thing. If you make the price drop, people will hate whoever is to blame, even if YOU bring the news. And if you make the price go UP people will love you. And then it doesn&#39;t matter if you speak the truth, or if what you are doing is hurtful or helpful to Bitcoin. Price alone will determine if they support you....<br/><br/>And this is most bizarre thing of all. This an attack on miners. That earn their money based on BTC price. So all the anger, and the support for Core, ensures the miners are making even MORE money. I am sure the BU miners will be angry with Jihan for this, lol!!!<br/><br/>More than ever, I think we are set for a hardfork. In fact, I think Core internally agreed to and planned for a hardfork when they ditched the Hong Kong agreement. What we are seeing now is not the fight to STOP a hardfork. It is the fight for the coin that will have the most support when it happens.",https://images.cryptocompare.com/39065/d64c06ec-2702-445c-ba5b-92e0d1de08cb.jpg,39065,Mng87,False,28031,False,False,1182,2017-04-06 07:44:51.703

Big players CANNOT dictate a trend. They can at the most hold it for a couple of weeks.

However, DO NOT just look at the futures elite sentiment index on OKCoin. Follow position size on Whalecalls. NOTE price points for increase and decrease of position! For instance, look at what happened near the bottom, where Friday rolled over on the drop, and as soon as it was clear that price would break Friday 9Am price on the quarterlies, we had a sell off not only on SPOT, but of OPEN interest on futures. A clear example of how futures traders betting short sold of spot to close shorts on profit, BEFORE spot would kill their position.<br/><br/>It is of no use to you to know that 60% of the elite index is long at price 1160, if they went long at 950!

This is a new form of money created on the basis of the program code.<br/>Bitcoin is not owned by any state, companies or individuals.<br/>Due to this, Bitcoin has become the world&#39;s first decentralized means of payment. Money transfers are made on the peer-to-peer principle — without intermediaries between the sender and the recipient.<br/><br/>Bitcoin advantages:<br/><br/>1. High safety level<br/>No one can block a Bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin does not depend on central banks, local and international laws, religion and other things. Banks and the government do not control your bitcoins — they are only available to you. The wallet is created anonymously. Cryptocurrency cannot be faked, and payments cannot be cancelled.<br/><br/>2. Cheap transactions anywhere in the world<br/>Transfer fees do not depend on the amount or location. They make up less than US$1 (regardless of the amount). You can transfer money to anyone from anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>3.

Instant transfers<br/>Bank transfers take 3–5 working days on average. The speed of transfers via Bitcoin is a few seconds, or, when you are dealing with large amounts of money, — 10–60 minutes.<br/><br/>5. Protection against inflation<br/>National currencies depreciate annually by 1–20 % (sometimes more). Bitcoin is backed by a limited number of units (21 million) and protected against inflation. Cryptocurrency is becoming more and more popular, since people do not spend money on fees and instantly exchange money. In the future, the world national currencies will be merged in a single digital Bitcoin currency!

1269,False,4,False,3,9,False,0,False,0,"Be careful.  Never buy BTU. This solution is backed by most Chinese miners, not the other nodes (exchanges, etc).  Testing of BU has been very erratic and led to some unacceptable bugs.  Also, playing with block size limits will prove to be the wrong way of dealing with scalability (Segwit has a long way of updates, but is much more future-proof).  The lead developer for BU is the very controversial Roger Ver.  His team of developers is so small, and does not share all the expertise of Core.  Roger Ver is betting on BU, betting that his many &quot;hundred of thousands&quot; of BTC converted into BTU will allow him to circumvent the will of the people who will keep believing on the original BTC and its better approach in term of scalability updates. BU can be compared to a dictatorship move, only powered by the money of very few individuals (if not only one) and their army of Chinese miners (pure muscles, no brain).  Roger Ver will just succeed to bring BTC lower for a moment, but ultimately, his prophecy will be doomed ;-)  I bet there will be a HF, and that BTC price will rise again after 2 weeks, the time for : <br/>1. BTU price to drop a lot, BTC price to drop as well but in a lower proportion than BTU.<br/>2. Chinese BTU miners to realize BTU won&#39;t be profitable for long as the people supporting BTC  will have the last word. <br/>3. BTC wil automatically lower the difficulty of mining, thus rebalance the capacity to validate transactions ( + benefits from Segwit)<br/>4. BTC price will rise again once BTU will be reduced to 5% of the market cap of BTC, not representing a threat anymore<br/>Conclusion : there is a short winter coming.. but it won&#39;t last long. <br/>I&#39;d recommend : <br/>&gt; Keep everything in Fiat currencies until the first days of HF.

The HF between Core (BTC) and Unlimited (BTU) will be effective as no consensus would be reached. <br/>2. The situation won&#39;t be comparable to the HF between ETH and ETC as here, the allocation of hashing power will not show a clear and immediate winner.   <br/>3. The price of both coins BTC and BTU will drop as the market cap for the sum of both will remain equal (or would even drop due to the lack of visibility and fear from investors).  This drop could reach a theoretical 50% due to the +100% dilution effect (people receive BTU &quot;for free&quot;; it&#39;s like inflationary policy of a Central Bank issuing an extra 100% of the currency currently in circulation).  For ETC, it did not happen this way as ETC impact was very limited (arount 15% of the sum of ETC+ETH market cap). <br/>4. As a paradox, this situation will relieve some pressure on the Backlog of BTC (better as e-gold), which will bleed hard but would not die.  <br/>5. Simultaneously, while BTC becomes boring, and BTU too (as BTU is controversial, represents a quick fix rather than a long term solution to BTC problems), innovation comes forward with a long term fix for BTC, this time with massive consensus (as there is no more rush for quick &amp; dirty fix on a boring BTC).  This long term fix will turn BTC into both, a perfect e-gold AND e-currency (New!).  That would reduce BTU into ashes. <br/>6.  BTC regains traction, keeps its No1 network effect and stays No1.. despite the rise and rise of dark currencies, threatening the supremacy of BTC, without bringing the destructive blow, as today&#39;s real life payments remain denominated in BTC (real merchants, online payments, etc) and today BTC market cap is still roughly 20x higher than Dash, its closer rival.  Also, not all exchanges offer Dash (and other dark currencies) in their trading list, thus it would slow down their adoption (at least until BTC long term fix). <br/><br/>As investor, I&#39;d therefore advise the sell BTC before the HF to stay out of this mess, to keep a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach during the week/month after the HF, and when the first signs of a long term fix for BTC emerges, buy back BTC.  Personally, I&#39;d never buy BTU. <br/>If you keep some BTC before the HF takes place, you take the risk that your exchange is too late in listing BTU (or that it happens during the night without warning) and that you are not able to quickly sell all your BTU into fiat currencies (or at least in BTC) as I predict BTU to drop more than BTC, as it represents the choice of miners, not investors.

This decision comes after careful consideration of our revenue and operating costs in Washington.

Since you are a Washington resident, we are sorry that we must suspend all services in your account. Services will be turned off in two steps according to the schedule below:<br/><br/>    Wednesday March 15th: Deposits and trading will be suspended for all Washington residents - please stop all trading before this date<br/>    Wednesday March 22nd: Withdrawals will be suspended for all Washington residents - please withdraw all accounts funds before this date <br/><br/>After withdrawals are suspended it will still be possible to get your funds, but you will need to contact support for special instructions and processing will likely take much longer than normal. If you have any trouble withdrawing your funds, please submit a support request to: https://support.kraken.com/hc/requests/new<br/><br/>Use the subject/category “WA Resident” to help ensure a quick response.<br/><br/>MtGox Creditors<br/><br/>If you have filed a MtGox creditor claim through Kraken, don’t worry.

1629,False,7,False,0,3,False,0,False,0,"58% of BTC is now JPY, more than every other currency put together. Will the big story in 2017 be how BTC  went mainstream in Japan? Once the Japanese actually start paying their electric bills in BTC then the Japanese electric companies will be stockpiling BTC (an interesting thought). But the real draw for the consumer is that BTC is deflationary, if a Japanese household bought themselves say $5000 worth of BTC in order to pay their electric bills for the next four or five years then the saving they would make over time would be well worth the effort if BTC continues to increase in value. Over time they would be using a smaller and smaller amounts of BTC to pay the same monthly bill. Its a very attractive prospect.<br/><br/>If this caught on then this could prove to be key in moving BTC from an asset into an actual mainstream currency. After all the Utility companies would start to spend it as well, or use it to finance their own mining activities perhaps?<br/><br/>If Japanese households start buying BTC  in large volume to pay future bills then the effect would be to increase the scarcity pressure on the price of BTC as they would be buying bitcoin and spending it and buying more bitcoin, which is very different from buying it and sitting on it or just doing chinese style washtrading.<br/><br/>Is this an incredibly shrewd move by Shinzo Abe? Power and water have to be paid month in month out, they are not like washing machines or cars or whatever where you just wait if you think the price will drop. Utility bills are timebound so if you pay them with bitcoin then you are going to be buying your bitcoin up front or even in bulk and paying it out over a period of time, using progressively smaller proportions of your BTC stash to pay your utility bills over time. <br/><br/>It seems that there might be far more to the use of BTC to pay utilities bills than meets the eye :)",https://images.cryptocompare.com/46283/2c2447cd-a517-4404-8393-e2b9c174c29a.jpg,46283,BACC57A1,False,21983,False,False,1182,2017-03-05 01:03:20.037

1709,False,3,False,0,5,False,0,False,0,"So my personal take on this...<br/><br/>*** Do remember, I could be wrong in the extreme. Make up your own mind about this!***<br/><br/>new information hit the market, that Winklevoss twins etc al, plus big guns in SEC and Bats had a meeting on the 14th. Minutes are not published, but an amendment with minor corrections was submitted on the 22nd. Memorandum of the meeting was published on the 23rd. Meeting with SolidX with fewer big guns held on the 22nd (?).<br/><br/>Reddit went nuts interpreting this as almost approval. Unfortunately none of these people seem to understand how regulation works, and what due diligence before a decision looks like. To me, NOTHING can be interpreted about the outcome from this, other than the SEC being EXTREMELY aware, that whatever will be decided can have serious ramifications, and that this is a highly unorthodox and controversial asset class.<br/><br/>The dynamic is thus. There are two people left on SEC. They vote on approval or disapproval. Chairman has tie-breaker. We know that the  other member is positive about Bitcoin. Yet that does NOT prove, that she is positive about the ETF proposals at hand, even if she IS in favour of some kind of ETF. The chairman is essentially the decider. He is going to be replaced soon by Trump appointees.<br/><br/>This means, that the ETF will be one of the last things he does. He will be remembered for it, regardless of what is decided and how it pans out. Giving unprecidented transparacy = covering your ass! If anything goes wrong (either from approval or disapproval), he wants to be able to say, I did my job. Everyone could follow the proceedings. There was no major dissent to the process. I was justified in my choice. Does this mean approval? No. Does this mean rejection? No.<br/><br/>It means chairman does not want to be the fall guy!<br/><br/>Talk about price reacting close to the 14th is bullsh!t. At this point in time, no decision has been made, and not even the Winklevoss twins know what the outcome will be. If they did, that would be insider trading, regardless of what they did (sell, buy, hold). The decision isn&#39;t in.<br/><br/>All this means is that the Chairman of the current SEC KNOWS that this could heavily impact his name and legacy. Due diligence and transparency is the way to mitigate the effects of potentially making the wrong call.<br/><br/>Signalling the decision, or it&#39;s bias, BEFORE announcement, so you can buy or sell BTC, before the ETF happens or not, is NOT something the SEC would do. It is insider trading. I can&#39;t believe the SEC would allow that to happen. I don&#39;t understand how those that are buying based on this news don&#39;t realize that if they interpreted this correctly, they are acting on SEC generated insider trading knowledge.<br/><br/>But they don&#39;t seem to care. Reddit Markets has gone into moon kid mode. Remember how near-sighted the community is, and how they overreact to news, and frequently interpret it entirely wrong.

1722,False,5,False,0,4,False,0,False,0,"This has been my considerations of the market over the last 24 hours. <br/><br/>*****<br/>I do NOT offer this as trading advice! Make up your own mind, and trade accordingly! I am not a professional trader, and you don&#39;t want my loss/win ratio! I write this to organize my thoughts, understand the market better, and collect inputs and feedback.<br/>*****<br/><br/>As we all can see, prices are swinging wildly at the moment. A couple of hours before normal business hours for SEC, we saw a huge surge in price action, that sent us parabolic. Right at the time, of the first possible chance of announcement of the COIN application, selling and buying entered a grind stage, at least on BitStamp. Buy and sell orders of all possible sizes flooded the completed trades. They executed so fast I could not even read them. Sellers were so aggressive they drove prices down.... on a parabolic drive up - this is not the same crowd (or rather sentiment) of sellers we saw on the drive up to 1071  a few days ago!!<br/><br/>As it became clear that no announcement came in the early US business hours, pressure began to subside, and prices went slightly up. But it was shortlived as they have dropped overnight, with quite a few dips to partake in. Clearly, this was positioning in FOMO for the SEC, and disappointment in no announcement, and then experienced hands shaking out the weak in the marketplace. The swings are large, so it is hard to have effective stops for a position. Which IMHO makes this a dangerous marketplace. We have possibly 13 business days to go, and being stopped out repeatedly by experienced traders that use the fear, greed and fomo of the weak to take their coins and money will proceed until we have clarity. It is clear that stop hunters have been at work during the night, and have been quite successful!<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons why I vowed to myself, that I would not hold position in the US business hours while we could get a COIN announcement - and only do quick smash and grabs on all other hours. The other reason is the odds and stakes of this ETF. There are several estimates at chances of success and what is at stake. If we look at the Needham report, chances are less than 25%. Generally  accepted ranges for price upon approval are 2-3k to 6xx upon rejection. Beyond explaining what this means for long term trends, let&#39;s look at those kinds of propositions. Personally I have signed up for getting the BATS rule making announcements sent to me directly upon publication. But even then, getting it within SECONDS of publication, I doubt I can understand it before the market reacts. And the market might initially react the wrong way, adding hazard to the situation. You can get stopped out, even IF you got it right!<br/><br/>With stop hunters at work, wild swings at low vol, and the potential for the market making the wrong initial reaction, using stops effectively is very tricky. Holding a position to the 11th with tight stops seems unviable. Holding a position with wide stops to the 11th presents large risks for losses. Believing that it will be an easy ride up or down if you have the right position is unrealistic. Study the past flash crashes, and you will see that even successful hardened bitcoin traders got it wrong repeatedly during the last crash.<br/><br/>With 75% chance of rejection (which I think is being generous, very few outside of Bitcoin even believe that it is this generous), you have a 75% chance of going from 11xx to 6xx in a flash crash. Conversely, you can go to 1400-1500 in a buying stampede that is also very, very short in time span (25% chance) with more to come in the next weeks. Also, we do have traders on the exchanges, that are not here for Bitcoin, but just for profit. Currently, despite the dangers of doing so, there ARE leveraged shorts and longs in the market (shorts dropping and longs rising). So reversals during a rise/drop are bound to happen as stops are triggered and profits taken, leaving the potential for being faked or stopped out, even with favourable price movement for the given position. This action, spurred by announcement, can happen at any moment, even when you are mid trade on another position, and have not set proper stops yet. Volume is low, tensions are high, and thus range is high with potential for many false starts.<br/><br/>I see more and more wildly unrealistic claims by the community on specialized news sites and on reddit. Articles are being lambasted for reporting outcome of the probability generator on BitMex, despite the results being generally far more positive than any credible report we have seen, and way more positive, than even the sentiment of the lawyer that drafted amends for the Winklevoss Twins amendments to SEC. Besides those positions that created those results are coming from the community of traders themselves, but they CANNOT accept those odds! Clearly, as a whole, the community is out of touch with reality.<br/><br/>There are many people that are asking for advice on setting large leverages, how leverages work on various sites, and how to set up yolo trades specifically geared on the SEC decision to make one shot millionaires. This IMHO adds even more instability to the market, and I don&#39;t consider this trading at all. Those kinds of positions are high stakes gambling = idiocy. The current odds are close enough to gambling as it is, there is no reason to make it worse!<br/><br/>To add to the problem, with the last surge, we have officially entered long pole territory, which means we are in the zone where flash corrections can happen just because the market is overheated. Looking at the price range over the last couple of years, it is very suggestive that Bitcoin is about to enter a new trend. Patterns mentioned are 3 year cup and handle, but also double and triple top. To be fair not all patterns pan out even if they complete, but this sets us up right for the trademark mentality of the bitcoin trader community, moon or doom. ATH legend and fear of past fractals is not improving the situation. There is no middle way of the road, and oddly enough, this mentality  is self-fullfilling on so many levels.<br/><br/>One could take a word of caution from the top trader futures sentiment, that they have been full bearish at almost all times since friday, reaching 57% at times for short positions. Sentiment has fluctuated wildly in since Friday, but at no point, except just now as I write this, has it switched to long. The top futures traders have gone bear, even though they were bull all week after the drop on the 10th. Short leverage is used a lot more than long. Personally, I think they are fluctuating because they are exiting position from the post crash retracement and building a new one. They are hedging - as they SHOULD! In general, you don&#39;t trade on a news day, before news has broken. Well given the situation, and they trade futures, they have no choice. Hedging is the only smart solution.<br/><br/>My guess: Shorts for the SEC which is the dominant position, and then long for this week on the weeklies, because they don&#39;t know when the decision comes and they have to take the current price level into account. If this is true, then they DO NOT expect a decision this week, but DO expect price decline on the quarterlies (despite promised lifting of withdrawal ban on Chinese exchanges being bound create a surge) and positive price development this week. No one has seemed to really noticed this, or if they have, don&#39;t talk about it. But a change in sentiment, closing of old positions and unfolding of a new trading strategy amongst what is probably not lone traders, but institutional traders, or maybe even a group of highly skilled professionals, is significant.<br/><br/>What worries me, for bitcoin, is that community sentiment and trading strategies are getting out of touch with reality, and entering what I can only see as an old and familiar territory: &quot;This time it will be different!&quot; It might, but chances are low, unless you believe that fundamentals with a SEC rejection can carry price into a new positive segment of price range on log scale. Personally, I doubt this and I don&#39;t believe in the approval. What worries me for the community traders is the high level of emotion being displayed. Fear of missing out, greed, fear of loss, fear of having made mistakes and abandonment of trading strategies, that are made with reason based on sensible risk and hedging. Trading on emotion is dangerous. This trading environment is equally dangerous, as it swings in large range quickly, is in precarious territory and has dangerous positions, dynamics and sentiments built into it.<br/><br/>You could argue, that this is temporary and will sort outself out in a few weeks. Well, in Bitcoin world a few weeks is ages. And once the COIN situation is sorted, we have SolidX coming up at the END of March, leading to what I see as a repeat of what is going on now.<br/><br/>In short, I find the current situation hostile to proper and well executed trading. That is why I am out of position, and staying out of position. WIth the Euro/USD pair showing improvement for USD, my current best move seems to be to withdraw all fiat from BitStamp and send it home in Euros. A surprising conclusion, but this is my outlook. You can argue, that I stand to miss out on a historical win. That might be right, but I don&#39;t think I do. I think that is out of touch with reality. How many of those people that claim ETF will bring comet like price surges long term actually understand what an ETF is, and under which circumstances they would pruchase BTC or hand it back to the market? How many leaders of businesses do we know of that think more of BitCoin than they do of blockchain technology? What if the demand for ETF shares just isn&#39;t there at the levels the community expects?<br/><br/>Or to say it in a different way, here is a different take on what the ETF means, has meant and WILL mean in the future.<br/><br/>http://woobull.com/estimates-on-the-price-impact-and-capital-inflows-of-a-bitcoin-etf/",https://images.cryptocompare.com/39065/d64c06ec-2702-445c-ba5b-92e0d1de08cb.jpg,39065,Mng87,False,21056,False,False,1182,2017-02-22 06:28:20.617

1809,False,0,False,0,5,False,0,False,0,"So, from the point of view on Bitstamp, the last pullback was not due to sell pressure, it was due to lack of interest. The path to a new high was clear, there just wasn&#39;t any takers. It is not so clear now. On the other hand, a sub channel within the channel that has supported us since the crash, has formed, and that provided support at the low at yesterday&#39;s meltdown.<br/><br/>The line can be drawn from the low on the 5th and the 8th, and it runs parallel to the main channel - so if the main channel is divided into quarters, where we are challenging the center trend line, we are bouncing around in the second lowest quarter. To underscore this, a 162 coin bid has recently been put into 1040 acting as support exactly on this line. A single 110 Coin purchase stabilized the latest rebound from topping out and going into a deeper pullback. The old 500 Coin bid @ 1025 acts as support from dropping completely out of channel and is currently at 762 - and since we know the futures game is important to the development of the spot price, these details matter!<br/><br/>It seems we are at a stand off. This large bid at the price of 1025 is sufficient to let us stay in channel until the OKCoin futures expire tomorrow at 9am (where we start a new week and a whole new game) - unless we see a 2000+ coin meltdown. Given that the bull seems to be suffering from exhaustion, but on the other hand reasonable supports bids have been put in place at the most immediate levels of support, I think that a drop out of channel is not to be expected in the next 24 hours. A challenge for a new high (beyond 1082) is also not to be expected, because the interest is clearly not there, and a single purchase on BitStamp for 110 coins stabilized the whole situation and put us into level trade - up though IS the path of least resistance.<br/><br/>Sideways we go for now, unless some major player decides to buy or drop coins in a pretty decent volume. And since the OKCoin futures expire in less than 24 hours, this could actually happen!

1820,False,2,False,0,0,False,0,False,0,"Will people be able to adapt to a price deflationary currency?  True, Bitcoin is technically monetarily inflationary, but if things go as planned, it will take decades (possibly a couple centuries) to replace global fiat currencies.  So here are a few economic thought experiments: <br/><br/>- Remuneration. Imagine the employer employee relationship.  With price deflation, an employee will need to expect that the employer will cut their pay over time.  A good employee would simply have his or her pay cut less.  How will this pan out psychologically for the employee?  In terms of productivity, it&#39;s a great thing if employees can adjust.  Get as much produced as soon as possible before the price of the product you are producing drops!<br/><br/>- Lending.  On the one hand interest rates will rise, because money will have more value over time (the definition price deflation), so lenders will be less willing to lend.  However, the borrowers will not benefit from inflation as they do today.  It will take quite an adjustment in mindset for a borrower realize the cost of their nominally fixed mortgage payments will increase over time.  While at the same time their home (or other asset) depreciates.  Perhaps BTC loan amortization schedules will have descending payment amounts.  Even better, savers will buy their homes with cash!<br/><br/> - Commodities and Goods. commodities will depreciate (including the mother GOLD, when the change in supply of BTC is less than the rate of change in supply of GOLD).  This could be very good.  If a commodity or good depreciates, then there is a large incentive to transport it, use it to build something, and sell it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>This all leads to the hording of currency.  Most economists would freakout at this, but think about it.  Shouldn&#39;t money be valuable?  Isn&#39;t saving good?  On the one hand, spending and lending is discouraged, and on the other speed of production is encouraged (because the cost of good and services will go up tomorrow, so make it and sell it today!)  <br/><br/>There is a price point for everything, but in a deflationary market things start to look much different than what people are used to today.  <br/><br/>Psychologically, will 1 or 2 generations be able to make the adjustment?",https://images.cryptocompare.com/15807/cd78aa87-20fb-42d7-b708-54a1e95e86f8.jpg,15807,larrysmith1000,True,20310,False,False,1182,2017-02-08 02:53:35.477

As far as I understand it, increase in price presupposes increase in demand. Thus the utility of using OBV as an indicator. Higher price means more people are willing to buy. Yet as far as I can see on the OBV, it is way lower than it was when we reached 1000. It took boatloads of volume to get to 1000 and after that the going got tougher, with the first spike towards 1040 being 1500 in volume and getting absolutely nowhere and ending in the tanking of the price.<br/><br/>Now this is the part that I don&#39;t really get. At the top of the downwards sliding channel, no one wanted to buy. Until someone put in a 500BTC bid at 1025. This bid never took any coins, nor did it move at all after the price started to rise. Positions just kept overbidding those 500BTC. It is still there as I am typing this.<br/><br/>All the way up, the tip of the bid pool was paper thin and only got trickle buys. The ask queue was just very small amounts of BTC. The slippage was massive, with 1-2 coins moving the price up to several USD. Yet at the stages where the price rise stopped, there is massive selling action. If you look at the 1 minute trace you can see almost no one is buying, but lots of people are selling.

1868,False,0,False,2,8,False,0,False,0,"This might sound paranoid, but the more I see, the more I am convinced that the whole BOOM/BUST thing has been a scam. A scam using loans and futures to pump the market, and increase capital, Then use that to buy shorts, leverage and crash the market. I have seen more than one person comment on the fact that the BTC futures have looked like BTC was on the brink of death. Just imagine the profits you could run on such a move. Now add to that, if you look at all but the initial crash, those sudden fire sales are counter intuitive to technicals and indicators. Like if you wanted to grab people while they wanted to pour money into the system and create maximum panic, you&#39;d sell at the times it happened.<br/><br/>Today, we have seen a run on BitFinex and BitStamp. Not with huge capital as such, but rather with very small sales, that hammered the price, right at the moment when it looked to correct. Seriously go in and look at BitStamp 15 and 30 minute MACD. Every time it look like it would correct, just enough was sold to hammer it down. What self respecting trader would do that? What trader would program a bot to do that? You KNOW that in just 10 minutes you are going to get a better price? And why only hit BitFinex, that only major USD exchange that still offers financial instruments, and Bitstamp that traditionally is the second largest USD market? And the growth of other USD markets in volume, that also dropped as they GREW in volume?<br/><br/>All day, bid orders in USD actually grew and the number of coins for sale dropped, yet prices dropped and dropped. To me, this tells a story of people that ran a racket, got busted by the PBOC, are on the squeeze on massive dues in shorts, and are now desperate to crash the price yet again. Literally, what I have seen today on BitStamp makes no sense. Price goes up, immediately hit with 0,0001 BTC sale at shit price. OBV only affected by the occasional massive dump of someone that panics and drops 40-150 coins. But those coins affect price just as much, or as little as those small targetted attacks of 0,0x BTC.<br/><br/>To me this stinks. Someone is trying, as has been trying to short the market since the first day of the crash... to get out of massive positions in shorts. What before the PBOC looked like a sweet business strategy has now become a game of desperation on the USD exchanges.",https://images.cryptocompare.com/39065/d64c06ec-2702-445c-ba5b-92e0d1de08cb.jpg,39065,Mng87,False,19945,False,False,1182,2017-01-29 23:46:15.827

Taking into account the current global political, &amp; financial climate with (good or bad no judgement here) Trump, &amp; The rise in populism in Europe and elsewhere w/Brexit etc. <br/> This is what got me into this crypto space (&amp; out of the stock market) in the first place and reminds me of the stories I heard growing up from my Father, Uncles and Grandfather.  So please indulge me if you will as I believe that there are some of the brightest minds around on this forum, &amp; I have a very serious ?<br/>So If BTC does Explode in value ( i&#39;m not referring to slow steady growth but hyper explosion) is that what we as a collective human race should be hoping for. If it happens,  It will most likely mean that the world economy has essentially collapsed, the US dollar drowned by Chinese debt &amp; many other factors eventually defaults, and we are in a &quot;WORLDWIDE&quot; depression where ALL FIAT currency is worthless. Essentially millions or even billions of people will be starving, dying, &amp; suffering causing violent chaos, &amp; anarchy worldwide.  <br/>{SomeContext}<br/> My Eldest Uncle was constantly harping about this at nausium until the day he died (in a different context &amp; time) but for most of the same reasons that I think parrerell BTC &amp; Gold. He illegally &amp; proudly horded gold after FDR took the US off the GS in 1933, &amp; late in life after Nixon&#39;s 1971 move to COMPLETELY detach the $ from any gold &amp; the subsequent 1974 law allowing  People to once again &quot;legally&quot; buy &amp; own gold again in the US. He bought as much as he could, along with my Father, they were getting One troy ounce of gold for around $40 as the family story goes &amp; just 6 years later Gold was worth $850. <br/>  Unfortunately because of some private family issues none of that gold is left. BUT my whole point &amp; question is as we see BTC and crypto currency&#39;s becoming a lot like gold but with a very fixed supply.  I&#39;m not certain we have to have a global crisis for BTC to reach those type of levels Just a lot of chaos &amp; uncertainty.<br/>Lastly, I think if we do have a true &amp; real catastrophic global financial meltdown of the magnitude of the 1930&#39;s &amp; the fiat US $ becomes as worthless as say Zimbabwe Currency (Around 200,000 Zimbabwe =$1) BTC &amp; all viable Crypto will be worth ungodly unimaginable amounts Millions/Billions Per.  My concern is that even in so-called &quot;strong&quot; democracies will they come after our BTC &amp; enact laws to make it illegal to own it like the United States did with Gold from 1933-1974.

2016,False,4,False,0,0,False,0,False,0,Good morning campers - well woke up to find that I had been completely stopped out @1040 - I think for all of us watching the Chinese Govts manipulation of the Forex/HIBOR jacking it to 45% earler in the day was a warning shot - thats when we saw our earlier run down to hit old trend supt (mid) of 1080 and then bounce upwards. We also had mexico pull the same deal too which is clearly reflected in the BTC movements.<br/><br/>I had a buy in set @925(pre tracking supt) so am in again. Looking at the charts we see the following:<br/><br/>2 week chart has two main levels to confirm trend support - 1015 lower and 1040 midline - if we hit these and continue with vol this should break upwards.If this breaks then we turn to the 3 month for next trend line which clearly has 850.<br/><br/>For this run I am setting my stops at 915.<br/><br/>Overall I am still very bullish on this one and we need to remember that every-time that a government pulls a stunt like this all this does to those shorting FX is to confirm weakness - this game does not play out (too expensive) in the long run and makes a mockery of these seeking to confirm their currency as a genuine reserve ;))). Now that we have broken 1k and everyone is comfortable with this value we will move back across it soon enough (imo).<br/><br/>Remember stops if trading!! -very best of trading/holding everyone ;))).,https://images.cryptocompare.com/24328/5b2df045-b82e-46f5-b30b-574a48ac2b4f.png,24328,24328(Deleted),True,18724,False,False,1182,2017-01-05 19:34:54.890

I checked yesterday when things were going great there was still 3 days waiting time on one purchase &amp; 2 days waiting time on the other the money had already come out of my bank account for both buys which is fine &amp; normal.<br/>BUT at 6:16 AM my time this morning when BTC dipped below $900 on Coinbase they released both buys early???<br/> Its not the first time I&#39;ve ever gotten it early but I can say that there have been other times when the &quot;arrives today&quot; status will go on for 36-48 hours.<br/>  My obvious question is are they manipulating when they release the coins and if so can they be trusted?

A Currency, Commodity, Neither, or Both?  A large MidCap commodity I guess?  But you run into the whole infinite (not infinite but unknown hazy guesstimates) supply of gold, oil, diamonds etc  that don&#39;t have fixed amounts other than the ones that the industries manipulate &amp; self-impose to control price. Whereas BTC, Zcash have EXACT fixed ammounts of 21 million making it unlike Fiat Currencies that print &amp; print &amp; print &amp; print backed by ??? Gold (laughable) or Commodities.

Of course these are my refferal links and I would appreciate if you used them, however feel free to take the ref part of the link out and sign up on your own. If you use my link you will earn the same i will just get a small bit of extra instead of the site owners. Anyway check below I have 2 sites Mbitco and Hashwave. Mbitco offers several different plans from 1 day to 5 days all the way up to 40 days with interest rates from %4 all the way to %1000, be aware the interest at this site does not accrue until the plan time is up. Hashwave on the other hand offers hourly interest and you can just more than double your deposit if you stay for the whole 30 days. I have not been here for 30 days yet but I have withdrawn my interest every hour for the few days I have been there with no problems and it is generating it as stated.

It&#39;s a paradox, considering the high volatility history, but things are changing quickly and in relative terms Vs other cryptos, yes, BTC will become a &#39;conservative&#39; asset.<br/>&gt;&gt; On the Hype-Cycle, Bitcoin has reached the plateau of productivity for its unique and unambiguous use case : Payment.<br/>&gt;&gt; Its use case is more primitive than Ethereum, much more.  But it does much better at on this unique Use Case than Ethereum does for its owns.<br/>2. Longer Term analysis :<br/>2.1. ETH will slowly recover with announcements of Devcon2, new use cases, and grow faster around mid 2017 with the emergence of use cases with real fundamental interest in private sector (that generates money, finally).<br/>2.2. BTC will continue to grow, especially in case of economic turmoil (which I fear more and more.  Look at the US interest rates, the nearly 20 trillion USD debt in the US, the ratio USD debt / GDP at its highest since WW2, the &#39;de-dollarisation&#39; of world central banks, the growing anti wall-street front of China-Russia-Iran-Turkey(new!)-...)<br/>And on the very long term, I fear a &quot;Rootstock&quot; option to mount smart contracts on BTC, combined with more efficient mining (smaller blocks) and off-chain transaction would make Bitcoin the supreme crypto-currency and Turing-Complete virtual machine that will govern the entire society.<br/>Ultimately, I wish you good luck in your investment guys !

Within the new model, maker fee is set to 0%. This is a major improvement to encourage even higher liquidity across CEX.IO markets.<br/><br/>What is Maker-Taker?<br/> <br/>If we take a closer look at the order execution, we can see that each trade involves two parties: the maker, who places the order in the order book, and the taker, who “takes” or matches the maker’s order. In a nutshell, makers create liquidity on the market, and provided that they play a longer game, they are usually rewarded with lower fees than takers. Takers, in their turn, use liquidity from the market by matching makers’ orders, which drives market movement and lead to tighter market spread.<br/><br/>How does Maker-Taker Fee System Work on CEX.IO?<br/><br/>The new fee structure on CEX.IO implies 0% trade fee for makers and standard 0.2% fee for takers on all trade pairs. Special trade conditions are discussable for high-volume traders, Verified Plus and Corporate accounts. Shortly, we will improve the Maker-Taker model by making it volume-tiered.<br/><br/>We highly welcome you to take advantage of the new fee schedule.

As @jerdalance points out The  Federal Reserve is printing money at an astronomical rate (wonder how many toners they go through a day &#129297;&#129300;) Come Saturday more than 75% of ALL BTC will have been mined &amp; the Fed will continue to print on average 1 billion in fiat Currency PER DAY. I think the absolute key is more vendors accepting it.  I&#39;m really surprised the PayPal thing hasn&#39;t gotten more attention. I paid my Dish Network Bill yesterday with bitcoin.  But 12 years from now when the reward is 1.56 I don&#39;t think will be using BTC that way anymore.  But rather a safe haven from inflation like gold is now.<br/>INFLATION IS INEVITABLE when there is an INFINATE AMOUNT of fiat out there backed by NOTHING. But BTC is because there is a FINITE AMOUNT. <br/>UNLESS there is a way to split, resplit, &amp; on &amp; on. I would Like to see bitcoin used as a REAL currency. <br/><br/>So for example you take BTC if &amp; when it reaches say $1000 &amp; then do a 10x split so now if you had 2 BTC now you would have 20 worth $100 each &amp;  then it can be used as a currency more realistically and the price can still continue to go up until it reaches another high and then split again. ( they&#39;ve been doing that for years with stocks but in this case there is a truly fixed amount) whether you call them Mini BTC  or Small Satoshi&#39;s Bits whatever you want.<br/> If something like that is not done barring any unforeseen crazy events happening the majority of all bitcoins will be mined in the next five years realistically.  The  average lower income person can&#39;t afford to set up an account and buy a few BTC to utilize as true currency to buy a cup of coffee or pay for a haircut, everyday items etc.<br/>The way it is set up now it will become more and more unattainable by those without the means.

As an introduction, let&#39;s take a look backward as to where this all began. During the 2000s I became intrigued by Forex trading but realized that the top of the food chain was to be the Broker. The Broker scores revenue whether the trade goes up or down based on spreads. The trader has all the capital at risk. Well -- the Hammerin&#39; Hank debacle and huge regulatory wave that followed resulted in huge capital requirements being imposed on IBs (Introducing Brokers) of Forex Trading exchanges. I was an IB and had just set up a managed FX fund as an LLC. We developed a trading partner relationship out of Chicago, but then FINRA came out with new regs that killed our enterprise. Fast forward to today. Now with BTC being listed on newer exchanges there are intriguing opportunities. Would some of you brilliant minds out there want to make contact to form an IBC and white-label as an IB to actually help BTC traders in the options arena? My web investigations have uncovered some linkages that if we brought the components together we could help ourselves and others, I believe, win big in the next few years as BTC continues to mature.

2662,False,6,False,0,6,False,0,False,0,@ZC86 @Cryptobond @Kanopt @wolf  to the brain trust is this QUICK SURGE like how stocks shoot up based upon estimated earnings but when earnings reports come out in there either negative or positive the bubble has already been created good or bad &amp; the market is ahead.  For instance when a Bluechip stock meets sales projections it doesn&#39;t really go up because people bought it thinking it would whereas if it does not meet projections it only goes down.  My question is should I move some money out of 401(k) and by say 10 bitcoins do you guys feel confident that the floor is say $400 or is this like the previous run up to $1200 and then crash. I know no one has the answer just best educated guess to me is this like the previous run up to $1200 (I wasn&#39;t into crypt then) and then CATOSTROFIC crash?

I could see if you had hundreds of bitcoins.  But the risk of having that much money in an exchange where it could be somewhat vulnerable for that type of ROI isn&#39;t really worth it to me. You said you get about 1% So if you loan out 20K in a month you make $20?  I guess it&#39;s better than nothing though.

The device uses the company’s new 16nm ASIC chips BM1387 and essentially triples the hashrate of the previous generation S7 miners while offering the same level of power usage. The Bitmain AntMiner S9 should be capable of 14 THS SHA-256 mining hashrate with a power usage of 1375 Watts at the wall, so definitely a good improvement over the S7.<br/><br/>So it might be wise to wait for a later batch of S9 miners after the halving to see how the situation will change and if you might get a better deal in terms of price for the hardware.

2783,False,0,False,0,0,False,0,False,0,"A Singapore-based startup, SearchTrade, has introduced a system to allow all parties in the Internet search engine process – the searcher, the owner of the key word being searched, the builder of the app using the search engine, and the advertisers – to profit from the process using bitcoin. Using bitcoin, the system redistributes the revenue among the stakeholders in the process, rather than allowing all the profit to flow to the big search engines like Google and Bing.<br/><br/>“Search is the single most important activity on the Internet,” said Vishal Gupta, co-founder and CEO of SearchTrade. Everyone does it, every day. Search drives far more traffic than any social network or viral news site, and it makes a ton of money.<br/><br/>We&#39;re asking people to imagine how much better the Internet would be if everyone could share the benefits of that activity.&quot;<br/><br/>Bitcoin micro-payments make it possible for all stakeholders in the search process a share in the income generated, Gupta said.<br/><br/>The four stakeholders are:<br/><br/>The person doing the search<br/>The person who “owns” a keyword being searched<br/>The builders of apps that use the search platform<br/>The advertisers who pay to advertise among the search results.<br/>SearchTrade takes the revenues paid by the advertisers and pays the other three parties, proportionate to their role in the process.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>SearchTrade uses a search engine based on existing platforms and is building its own additions. Gupta said developers are building more localized options since he wants to give users as much choice as possible.<br/><br/>Three Ways To Earn Bitcoin<br/><br/>Stakeholders can earn payments in three ways:<br/><br/>1. By searching. Performing a search earns the user a small fraction of a bitcoin, which goes into the user&#39;s wallet.<br/><br/>2. By “owning” key words. SearchTrade provides an exchange platform for users to buy and sell key words. Users can buy key words they think will be popular in searches. Each time someone searches that term, the system rewards the “owner.” The key word prices are set by the open market.<br/><br/>3. By building web and mobile apps that use SearchTrade&#39;s platform. Developers earn bitcoins when a user performs a search using their app, when searcher is signed-up as SearchTrade user.<br/><br/>SearchTrade is seeking developers to build hundreds of apps that include its search facilities. About a quarter of the revenue is shared among these developers.<br/><br/>SearchTrade limits the number of searches per user to 40 per day. This is to deter “click farms” – operations that game advertising systems by using them 24/7 using cheap labor. SearchTrade also limits access to individual IP addresses.<br/><br/><br/>Articles<br/><br/>Cointelegraph - Search Your Way to Millions?

From there pool will track average income per search that platform is able to generate every 24hrs and decide what average payout per search should be. The cycle of pool calculating payout will have to reduce over period of time with increase in traffic so as to ensure pool never runs out of money.<br/><br/>That way income generated from Keyword sale to advertiser and Income distributed to keyword owner is de-linked from each other.<br/><br/>At launch we will use btc collected from presale to give payout. lets say @ 400 satoshis per search. Which means each stake holder Search User, Keyword owner, App Developer and Searchtrade itself will get 100 Satoshi&#39;s to begin with. Post this as traffic increases and we start generating ad income along with other sources of income we switch system to auto decide payout based on algorithm defined above. <br/><br/>General Queries &amp; Accusations<br/><br/>A. Are we a ponzi scheme or genuine business? there is no way to judge peoples intentions and proof of pudding is in eating it.<br/><br/>B. We have been working on this since two years and have built team of 50 developers.<br/><br/>C. Payout alters on a simple math that will evolve over time to keep pool profitable at all times. <br/><br/>Current math : Total searches / total income / number of users / 90 = payout <br/><br/>D. Keyword Pre-sale prices will reduce after every sale based on slabs (Predefined) since all keywords cant make same amount of money and it is common sense that people buying first will target best keywords.<br/><br/>E. Funds that we have collected get scattered in multiple wallets to protect both us and our users from attacks. We take fund safety seriously.<br/><br/>F. Keywords owners can trade keywords with each other so trade-able value of keyword could be higher than actual income it makes. E.G. if Word bitcoin had earning of 100$ a year it could be traded in multiples of 10 and be valued at 1000$ as it would imply 10% return on investment.<br/><br/>G.
