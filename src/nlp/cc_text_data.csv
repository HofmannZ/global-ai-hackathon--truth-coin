Now all that&#39;s cool if I sell it. But what happens if I place a limit order to sell this coin when its price goes to 0.2 but at the same time BTC fell vs EUR or USD? What I&#39;m trying to say is that I&#39;d like to get a value on EUR whenever I place an order so I know for sure I&#39;m making profit when I decide to sell my coin lot. Am I making any sense? ?? How do you deal with pure crypto2crypto trading? Any help greatly appreciated! &#128517;"

That should reduce the load to around 200 requests per second per server, well under my 300 threshold.

91,2017-06-17 22:34:45.947,"Hello everyone, <br/><br/>Sorry for the increased tension in the forum. I thrived to create an atmosphere in which everyone respects other&#39;s idea. Many avoided the confrontation to open this passage, I did it for you. And nobody owns this forum alone.  <br/><br/>Now there is an undeniable amount of users who are concerned  about miner decentralization. I am one of those concerned users. As one of commentators rightfully demanded we need solutions rather than complaints. <br/><br/>I will do some brain storming here. So no idea is stupid. &quot;You know nothing&quot; is not an counter-argument. <br/><br/>what can we do against miners centralization?<br/><br/>(1. uasf: This is the nuclear option, better if it would be enough to motivate miners to activate segwit peacefully just like it happened in litecoin. Read charlie lee&#39;s tweets to find out how he used that uasf card successfully. I have wrote a lot about it. I am not going to repeat it. go to my profile and read please.) This became very political. So putting in parenthesis to focus on  other options. <br/><br/>2. When the dust settles, we wont have much issues to fight about possibly in september. but miner centralization is not going anywhere. Then comes BITCOIN HALVING around Jun 20th, 2020. <br/><br/>Bitcoin halving reward 6.25 BTC<br/>Block tx fees total minimum: 3 BTC. <br/><br/>Fees will be 30-50% of miners income! <br/><br/>Not every transaction is urgent, right? Are you waiting for a transaction send between your own wallets to be verified during midnight? Possibly there are  some users (like me) not content with paying a pool whose actions are not plausible, or because they are just too powerful. How about we are given a choice on wallets to blacklist certain miners at the cost of a delay proportionate with the total blacklisted rashrate. For instance if I blacklist antpool, i will see a 18% delay. Anyway I am sleeping at that time. <br/><br/>Tx info will be sent over a dedicated channel so that receiving miner will not propagate that fearing he may be blacklisted as well. Because your wallet will say blacklist worked.  <br/><br/>If enough people does that, that miner can not say &quot;users are nothing&quot;. <br/><br/>And if 50% does that, this will be 15-25% loss for that miner. They can not compensate that easily (even with asicboost) i believe.<br/><br/>Miners will be scared of being in the same photo shot with the blacklisted miner fearing a negative impact on the business. <br/><br/>Please correct me if I am wrong. <br/><br/>This can be a BIP if we can get enough support. Please feel free to criticize.  <br/><br/>Geeks can still do this. But the important thing is bitcoin wallet provides this as a reference and other wallets follows it. <br/><br/>3. This is more futuristic. <br/><br/>Total hashrate: 5 million TH/s. <br/>there are usb miners with 50 GH/s like 21.co.  In the future, if bitcoin gets enough reach, 100 million usb miners would make a 50% share in doubled total. This is an enough action to prevent behind the closed doors meetings. Because excluding 50% hashrate from meeting would make meeting invalid. <br/><br/>Compare this number with the total 7.19 billion mobile phones as of 2014 stats. <br/><br/>This action requires educating new generations about crypto currencies and the need for decentralization. The miners shall either mine in democratic pools or solo mine. Notice the user does not expect a mining income but a collective ideal. <br/><br/>These are my solutions i have in mind. Please feel free to criticize and make corrections. I sensed that there are more well-versed people in bitcoin than me in this forum that can contribute to this discussion. My ideas might be totally stupid or against your ideas. Counter arguments are appreciated to reject or improve them."

I have holdings in both BTC and ETH at a ratio of about 1:7.  I figure if flippening hits and BTC tanks, then the value I lose in my BTC will be taken up by ETH. And vice versa should ETH tank.  Either way I maintain my holdings total value. Alternatively, if I wanted to go all or nothing I could put my money into just one.  Then I&#39;d have the chance of doubling the value of my holdings.. OR losing everything.  To me the choice is obvious - the ride is wild enough without taking a shot at doubling my gains.  My guess is that most others in the same game will chose likewise.  That being the case we might approach flippening - market value of ETH passing that of BTC - but then we&#39;ll get stuck there with the two being near equal."

I have provided the best sourceable information I could find since I started here. I was amongst the strongest opponents of the &quot;china will have a fire sale of BTC&quot; when PBOC smacked the Chinese exchanges right in the face. I was instrumental in constructing hedge strategies in the ETF confusion, and totally right against massive protests, that the ETF would be denied.<br/><br/>Even though I did not believe in this rally, I have provided support points for the bounce expect the last one, where I have sent punters to better chartists than me, that ultimately proved to be right. I have selected experts on investment advice without looking at their sympathies to one faction or another. I have provided accurate and real-time tradeable charting and advice in the latest and most difficult parts of this rally.<br/><br/>And yet, people that accuse me of the most ridiculous and insane things are getting upvoted by members that have been here for a long  time, and know better.<br/><br/>This is what I have to say to you.<br/><br/>I have talents. I can go elsewhere. If you don&#39;t want me here, then I have no problem turning my back to this site, and to crypto in general. The thought that BTC can be whateever some faction with sufficient propaganda power decides it should be, and that the consensus rules that are embedded in the design from the very beginnning and into the code now ultimately means NOTHING AT ALL, tells me that crypto, whatever potential it might have had, is doomed. You will never be able to make a long term deal, because the asset you bought will not in any way be the asset you sell. Crypto ultimately suffers the same political corruption and power centralisation, through the same bullshit methods from local politicians, that every other man made system has. In the end utility is eaten by greed.<br/><br/>If you really want to support someone that lies to you each and every day, and who tries to make you believe that I am E. G&#252;n Sirer, and that I support all sorts of things that I have never uttered any support for, then all I can say is:<br/><br/>Farewell, fuck you and goodbye.

131,2017-06-16 07:45:53.390,"Some people like mng87 here says he is not pro-Jihan but pro-Hong Kong consensus.<br/><br/>Let&#39;s analyze what this means. Hong Kong agreement was a behind closed doors meeting. Who were behind the closed door, some miners and their miner supplier. And those miners are scared of offending their miner supplier (no brainer; do not offend your supplier if you do not have any better alternatives). If you are pro-{CLOSED_DOOR_MEETING} you are also pro-dominant actor at a ratio of his influence.<br/><br/>While core didn&#39;t fully attend and endorse the meeting, some blame them for not keeping a promise given by some individuals behind closed doors. Core team has the track record of doing the technically right thing, you can not expect them to implement something because of such a promise. Even Janet Yelen does not increase interest rates just because she promised the biggest bank (at least ideally).<br/><br/>Satoshi&#39;s white paper says: &quot;one CPU one vote&quot;. IMO this means you should not be able to put stake holders/decision makers in a room. Simply they should not be that few to fit in a room. <br/><br/>QUESTION: While US congress is 535 representatives (elected democratically) why would &quot;bitcoin congress&quot; be limited to couple miners and businessmen? Besides the majority of these miners elect themselves by bribing individual miners. One can buy all this so called consensus by investing $1 trillion in miner production/bribery. Such a purchasable consensus.<br/><br/>Slush pool is maybe the only democratic mining pool by giving miners right to vote. <br/><br/>New York agreement is still behind the closed doors meeting. <br/><br/>These so called consensus among couple individuals is not the consensus Satoshi planned for/designed. Religiously believing in this kind of consensus is very naive. <br/><br/>Any opinions trying to answer the question above welcomed. Maybe I am wrong I would learn something new.

171,2017-06-15 11:54:00.977,"I think we need a digital cryptocurrency, which would be fully backed by dollar 1=1, which would replace BTC as the main trading pair for alts. BTC/Alt pair was great, when BTC (its price) represented the Blockchain and its potential, but that no longer holds, when the MarketCap of BTC has fallen below 50%. Bitcoin now has become one of the many cryptos (though still the biggest). It&#39;s like if all stocks on the US stock market where denominated in Apple shares. Combine a digital currency fully backed by the dollar (or more main fiat currencies) with a decentralised exchange, such as the one Waves is creating and trading would be much better. I understand the main problem with a fiat backed crypto is that you would have the trust the emitter, that they would give you the same number of dollars in exchange for the crypto. All the fiat would have to be locked in some sort of escrow, so that there would be only as much Crypto dollars as their are dollars in the escrow, unlike with banks, which have much less cash than people deposited, so that there is full liquidity."

On average lending rates on BTC seem to be around 0.1% - that&#39;s &#163;10&#39;s per day if you have &#163;10,000&#39;s which works out at &#163;3650&#39;s per year.

236,2017-06-13 12:38:34.743,"Please denounce scammers like altcoiner.net. They are wreacking havoc on people&#39;s hard-earned bitcins. I am a victim of altcoiner.net and shall do everything possible to stop them. <br/><br/>My experience with Bitcoin investment company: Altcoiner (www.altcoiner.net)<br/><br/>From their homepage, this company looks very serious. Their moto: &quot;AltCoiner – At the forefront of AltCoins Trading&quot; and the ABOUT US is convincing! They offer three investment plans for Bitcoin owners. You deposit a specified amount of Bitcoins for the level and each day, you receive a corresponding interest added to your account. The site is professionally done and can fool normal users. Registration is traightforward. They even advise you to start with very little amount to get used to the system and increase gradually. So, yu feel confident they are not after your hard-earned Bitcoins. So, you open an account for the lowest tier. You deposit a reasonable amount. You get an acknowledgement and the amount is posted in your account. Then, like magic, you see your earnings added to your account. Each deposit cannot be withdrawn before 5 calendar days. Each time you add money to your account, the 5-days start all over again. <br/><br/>There is abolutely no reason to be supsicious. Nothing at all. Everything looks normal. Deposits are acknowledged as soon as they are confirmed by the network. Account is credited with both deposits and interest, so you see your account growing. You think any time, when you need the funds, you&#39;ll claim it and this very honest company will return your Bitcoin with the earned interest.<br/><br/>Here is my experience:<br/><br/>Deposits<br/><br/>10 May: 0.30 BTC<br/>11 May: 0.14 BTC<br/>22 May: 0.90 BTC<br/>22 May: 0.767 BTC<br/><br/>Total: 2.107 BTC<br/><br/>With my amounts deposited (under 3.99 BTC), I fell under level 1 investment. I chose 100% compunded interest, which is offred as option.<br/><br/>On May 30, my principal and interest had amounted to: 3.7483362. I was bout to add more funds to move to the next level, as it did not rrequire much. Before that, I decided to test their withdrawal speed, just in case I needed the money urgently one day.<br/><br/>So, on may 30, I requested a withdrawal of my principal and interest. Alcoiner retained their 5% fees so the amount due to me was: 3.5610119.<br/><br/>From that day, it still shows as pending in my account. However, to date, not an single message from the company. No response to three support tickets. TOTAL SILENCE.<br/><br/>Maybe I have lost this important amount to me. It has alsoo shattered my initial enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, because there really isn&#39;t a way from keeping company like these to operate without any warning to the unawares. as of writing, this company&#39;s website is still there, probably accepting new users and their Bitcoins. Nowhere to go to be warned against such unethical business behavior! Due diligence is not enough. <br/><br/>So, in conclusion, please STAY AWAY from alcoiner.net. Let my experience be a warning to you and do not repeat my mistake. They are very clever, as dishonest people usuall are. Even after this warneing, if you gp to the website and read what they are offering, you may have some doubts. Do not. you have been warned. I wasn&#39;t."

244,2017-06-13 00:55:33.610,"Great question and although I believe that logarithmic charts are a more accurate visual, I have to go back to what I&#39;ve learned in 35 years of following the stock market. Never buy anything making new highs, the law of large numbers probably excludes the possibility of another 30X move in ETH. The same law applies to BTC as larger percentage moves upward become more difficult. If your question is a trading question, good luck, nobody knows where these two cryptos are headed day to day. ETH and BTC are two very different cryptos that have two very different functions. I have been in BTC for 3+ years and ETH for a little over a year. Long term I think that both have great potential with very robust backing and strong customer/user support. The road will be rocky but when the dust settles, I think that BTC and ETH along with LTC will be at the top of the heap. Thanks for reading and I am hopeful that this helps, even if only a little."

258,2017-06-12 18:00:32.187,"The pair ETH and BTC only has a 25% difference in market cap.  In this context, if e.g. BTC makes a -12.5% and ETH a +12.5%, it would be enough to reach a historic moment with BTC being uncrown as No1.   And then, you&#39;ll have a tsunami of news, respectively against BTC and in favor ETH (to a lower extend because it&#39;s also overpriced), but for sure against BTC, there is no doubt about that !<br/>In such scenario that is not a millions of miles away, the psychologic blow to BTC would be enormous, as one of the only strength of BTC resides in its powerful network effect.  I predict a long winter for BTC, possibly as long as 6 months.. if not more, from which it might never recover.  <br/>I also predict that in the short term most altcoins with low cap (lower than ranking #15), with poor quotations in term of market cap in &quot;everything that is not Bitcoin&quot;, that they will suffer a lot, in a proportion that is higher than BTC, as observed during the last small crashes.  When BTC his massively hit, the behavior that prevails is to protect your investment in fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc), not to play with those pairs &quot;CryptoXYZ / BTC&quot; anymore !   During those BTC crashes, at best, these altcoins were paired with BTC (meaning you lose in USD equivalent), at worst, they declined in BTC (meaning you lose even more in USD equ.)<br/>In this environment, it becomes much more lucid to simply... short BTC and not to be exposed to the rest for a while (at least)"

As mentioned in a previous post ascending wedges are bearish and have a low chance of breaking up, Even if they break up they have a good chance of throwbacks. The same is true if they break down. We completed a wedge formation that broke up after a fakeout recently, and the information on these wedges can found in the posts I made there. <br/><br/>We have a BIG wedge from the old ATH to the recent new ATHs - top trendline (resistance - bitfinex draws this back to the ETF rejection rise, and Bistamp draws this back to the recovery in January post PBOC ban Bitcoin). Low trendline is the wick on the big drop, and the dips through out till now (support). Convergence and resolution no later than the 14th. We are also in a smaller ascending wedge, from the drop from the ATH to the 2600 range. So ascending wedge-ception.<br/><br/>This could be a big move up or down. Targets for the big wedge are measured in the distance of the big drop from ATH (partial returns). Resolution of the smaller ascending wedge does not garantee resolution of the other in the same direction.<br/><br/>So... bearish chances, but lots of variance involved. Not calling this in direction. All I can say is when this thing moves, expect volatility. Violent jerks up and down."

353,2017-06-07 15:02:14.167,"Just for clarity and reading purposes not to troll but im out now<br/><br/>Ethereum likely to be #1 by August:&#160;https://forums.prohashing.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=1541<br/><br/>This is an interesting read.<br/><br/><br/>I&#39;ve been warning for years that bitcoin&#39;s future was in jeopardy due to the 1MB transaction limit. I pointed out that ETH would rise to $100, that LTC was undervalued at $4, and that bitcoin transaction fees would likely be at $50 by the end of the year. Today, I&#39;m sorry to announce that the last of those warnings is likely to come true this week: we paid $37.32 for a single transaction this morning. As a result, we increased our bitcoin payout threshold to $250, at a time when the threshold for all other coins remains at $1. These payout transactions cost less than 50 cents at the beginning of the year.<br/><br/>Another warning that received substantial criticism back in 2014 was my prediction that the next bubble would be popped by the transaction limit. It is now difficult to see a world in which this prediction doesn&#39;t come true. Bitcoin is a broken, unusable, unaffordable network, and people are leaving it in droves. About 98% of our desired transactions are suppressed; if the space were there, we would expand our usage over 25 times (and end up paying even more fees in the end).<br/><br/>That&#39;s why I now believe it is more likely than not that Ethereum will become the #1 market-capitalized cryptocurrency before August 5. There is a large disconnect between the truth on the ground and what people believe.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I do not believe that ETH will follow the same bubble cycle as Bitcoin did, and as many people believe it will. ETH is in a fundamentally different position than Bitcoin was. Bitcoin had its first few bubbles, especially the two in 2013, for its potential rather than actual usage. Until now, there was little actual usage of cryptocurrencies, resulting in &quot;potential&quot; bubbles"
354,2017-06-07 14:24:26.067,"Many people seem to interpret Bitcoin with extreme views, as being either an amazing concept bringing a lot of traction, or as being a pure bubble.  I personally think it&#39;s both at the same time these days.  It&#39;s not black or white.  Many ICO&#39;s/ Altcoins are promising, yet, they haven&#39;t brought any added value to people daily life yet.  At least, not the billions of USD equivalent that poured into these cryptos.  That&#39;s why I call it a bubble too.  The only real added value so far is  : investment vehicle bringing profits, not even as currency in real life.. the trend of merchants accepting cryptos is even declining. It was a sort of fantaisie.  It&#39;s not mature enough, with those transactions fees being so high for small tips."

379,2017-06-06 14:54:43.010,"There are so many articles telling that the price would likely reach 10,000 USD in the near future.  This blind view on reality starts to smell really bad;  Many people made huge profits from the years 2013 (or before) till now.  And suddenly, you&#39;ve the masses trying to follow the same behavior.. it&#39;s just that they are too late; but at the same time, I say thank you if you could make the bubble reach a very last +20% before the massive crash.  Don&#39;t take me wrong : Bitcoin is fabulous, with massive network effect as No1 crypto, but please, folks, don&#39;t believe it will reach the moon anytime soon, considering we are already moon-landing following the hundred % gains ;-)<br/>These days, very last followers can&#39;t resist investing, simply as they also want to be part of that easy money.. then, you&#39;ve the friends of friends, etc.  It looks like people feel they are losing money if they do not buy Bitcoin.  That is exactly what happened days before the dot com crashed in 2001"
380,2017-06-06 14:26:38.927,....Heres the drop!!!
381,2017-06-06 10:35:09.787,"Woke up a little early. Guess it is the adrenline from the price jump that is messing with my sleep. Been looking around for a damage report. Here are some numbers and musings.<br/><br/>The contract position I posted yesterday was a liquiduation of a the size of 13 million USD. In ONE account! That was a short position.<br/>#1 Top holder on OKex (same exchange) lost about 1,5 million USD last night.<br/>#2 Top holder on OKex lost about 650,000 USD last night.<br/>1K margin shorts on Bitfinex escaped before the price jump. 4K did not. That is a lot of wrecked trading accounts.<br/><br/>Similar positions have been eliminated on Bitmex futures.<br/><br/>These are not random degenerate gambler positions, at least not all of them. The top traders on OKex are JUST THAT, top traders. The best on the exchange, measured over a long time period. Most of them probably enjoy some level of information access, that we plebs do not have.<br/><br/>Top trading advice is to never short a bull run. So what are they all doing? I think I know. It wasn&#39;t dumb, it was just wrong timing, and this was a deliberate attack on short positions. Why do I say this was a deliberate attack? Look at Cryptomarket cap numbers. Select 1 day range:<br/><br/>https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/<br/><br/>See that drop in alt market cap? It comes JUST before total market cap (that is bitcoin, since alt went down) explodes, then wobbles. About 4 Billion USD in market cap moved IN/OUT/IN/OUT in the space of 2 hours. That is not BTC - ALT and back, it is BTC - FIAT - BTC -FIAT - BTC. That sh!t is crazy... Steriod level straight jacket insane, and there is no way this can be called &quot;difference in opinion about BTC value&quot;. This was a correct observation, that the market was OVER-LEVERAGED, and that was exploited massively for profit.<br/><br/>What is over-leverage? It is when margin positions are way out of any reasonable expectation of a return on the position they have taken. How do we know this was the case?<br/><br/>Example from before the crash: <br/>Bitfinex lending rates hit 0,4% a DAY... this means a loan taken out to go margin long at say 2400 USD, expects the following:<br/>((1+rate) lifted up to 365 days) - 1 = approx 330% price appreciation over one year for BTC, just to BREAK EVEN! That means that if BTC in one year of this position is at 8K, the holder of this position is BREAKING EVEN - that is NOT seeing profits! Clearly, at this point, just buying BTC cash on spot is a better option, unless you are targeting much larger price appreciation.<br/><br/>I like BTC too, but that sh!t is crazy... it is far beyond what is realistic. And others have probably spotted this as well, hence the large interest in going short on those expectations.<br/><br/>During the recovery rates have dropped a bit to about 0.2% daily. That is still a 108% annual appreciation target to break even. Thus a position at 2400 USD on the run up here, requires 4800 USD coins within a year trajectory to break even. You must assume these longs want to see profit, so in reality, the price appreciation must be on a much steeper slope, or they will lose money even with price going up! These loans are 30 day MAX periods.<br/><br/>We don&#39;t know how long these funds have been reserved for, but they have to see SHARP appreciation on the short term to even be viable.<br/><br/>The problem here is that we now have destroyed the short positions on Bitfinex. There is a now 7K margin longs that are NOT covered by margin shorts, should they decide to take profit. And they have to take profit within 30 days. That is if those positions are all assumed to be fresh from today (which they are not). Those shorts are not coming back any time soon after this burn... which means, if those longs are NOT covered by fresh money injections within the next 30 days, BTC price cannot even remain flat. And Bitfinex cannot let new money IN! Other exchanges can, and price can go up there, but NOT on Bitfinex which is market USD leader!<br/><br/>Spotting the short opportunity was the right call, and it was deliberately wrecked once it was set up! That is what I mean by this being a deliberate attack. That money that saved the longs is allied with the longs in some sense, so they are NOT willing to pay their profits. It has to be fresh cash injections of 675.000 USD a DAY just to remain at this price point (bitfinex calculations, not covering the whole market).<br/><br/>What we do not know at this point, but I am sure many of the shorters knew, is what other leveraged markets are doing. We can see Bitmex, but we cannot see the whale exclusive margin trading on GDax, and the prime customer exclusive margin trading BETA testing programme on Bitstamp. But I am sure many of these wrecked shorters could, and that the picture was similar to Bitfinex, but maybe not quite as insane. If anyone has access to these markets, I would like to know about the funding rates!<br/><br/>But in short (sorry for the pun), either we get LOTS of new money injections, EVERY DAY for the next month on ALL exchanges, that want to buy BTC for holding, NOT alt trading, then correction is inevitable. All it takes is for a sizeable chunk of margin longs to take profit, and not be covered by new longs, and the existing pool will see a substantial price appreciation go into loss because of the funding rate they are paying every single day.<br/><br/>Make your bets gentlemen... we need LOTS and LOTS of new cash just to stay floating, to say nothing of appreciation, on an exchange, that is market USD leader, that cannot get new cash.<br/><br/>What will happen? Will the other exchanges have healthier funding markets and long/short positions? Or will Bitfinex crash, and the other exchanges do what they did at the low of the dump, namely refuse to correct to it, and dethrone Bitfinex (and polo with it since they run in tandem) for good?<br/><br/>I dunno... I really don&#39;t. But I can see why newworldchaos would put all in fiat. In fact, despite the price jump and BTC moving UP while I slept, I am tempted to IGNORE dips and stay in fiat too. And I am not touching a SINGLE alt!<br/><br/>Good luck to all of you traders/hodlers and so on.... I don&#39;t know where this ends. If the hype cycle is strong enough, this can still go 5K before UASF becomes a serious issue. We could stay flat. We could crash, and yes to 1250 or lower.... I don&#39;t know. All I can say is I expect volatility. A lot of it, even if we remain flat in total."

From 2460 JUST today, without any real sustained selling action. Dips are no longer 45 minute events, they last 5 minutes or less. Not saying we are crashing today, but we will see 2600 very soon and possibly a bit lower than that. I am guessing that, because we built almost zero support from 2600 up, and bitcoin always overshoots a bit (or I am overdoing it). I am taking a shower and going to bed, setting an alarm for 2700. Happy trading to the brave."

I opted for the Bitstamp chart, because that has some noise we need to deal with.<br/><br/>As you can see, it is a chart on the 4 hour range, Bollinger bands turned on. There are two shapes to deal with. One is the triangle and the other is a wedge. I vote that the triangle is noise, and the second supporting candle should be used, and thus the wick on the drop candle cut. I say this because both Coinbase and Bitfinex have the same wedge and none of this noise going on. On Bitfinex, the wedge is beautiful and completely complimented by the Bollinger bands.<br/><br/>If you switch to the 2 hour range and/or the 1 hour range, you can see on the hist of the MACD how momentum strength is waning with every new high in the wedge, which is part of the pattern characteristics.<br/><br/>So what does this mean?

NY agreement code is not around AFAIK. Even if it is ready tomorrow, compare it with core&#39;s meticously tested, peer reviewed code. Activated on LTC without any issues. I guess nobody wants to see BU bugs on BTC nodes/miners. <br/><br/>2. If the monopolies win right now, get ready for the next manipulations and stumbling blocks serving only the monopolies. Expect more pump and dumps. Since the foundation of bitcoin will be damaged; the CONSENSUS &amp; DECENTRALIZED POW HASHRATE. Expect more behind the closed doors meetings resembling Fed meetings. Which one do you trust more: a few Chinese miners (ruled by communist party) or central banks? IMO not much difference. <br/><br/>Avoid the FUD denouncing UASF, they are trying to scare you so that you wouldn&#39;t revolt against your hashrate lords. if there is enough support, UASF chain will survive in case of a chain split since it has more strict rules, the legacy chain will encounter re-organizations all the time making your transactions invalid no matter how many confirmations you get.<br/><br/>Even if UASF does not happen, currently this is your only card against the monopolies.

Over the past few years, we have received frequent requests to launch a variety of digital assets on our exchange. Our stance, as a sophisticated digital asset trading platform that serves millions of users around the world, has always been to be prudent about adding new digital assets that have not been fully tested by the market. <br/><br/>Recently, OKCoin users have taken interest in the development of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), and there is an increasing demand for OKCoin to enable ETH and ETC trading. For the past two years, we have been constantly reviewing the viability of listing ETH and ETC based on factors including technical maturity, innovation, market liquidity, and compliance. <br/><br/>Today, we are formally launching ETH on the OKCoin exchange. Ethereum has a current circulation of 90 million, with ETH reaching a market cap in excess of USD 10 billion, and a total hashrate of more than 25K GB. Hundreds of applications are now built on Ethereum and a growing number of applications are using smart contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain. <br/><br/>More than 20 top global financial institutions and technology companies, including JPMorgan Chase, CME Group, BNY Mellon, Thomson Reuters, Microsoft, Intel, and Accenture, have set up the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) to define enterprise-grade applications of Ethereum. China&#39;s Tencent, Zhong An Insurance and other well-known companies are also investigating various applications of blockchain. The United Nations has just launched its first large-scale Ethereum test to distribute humanitarian funds. <br/><br/>Given this opportunity, we implore BTC Core developers and relevant Miners to work together and resolve any outstanding technical issues, activate Segwit, and solve BTC’s scaling issues. Our industry and the history of technology offers us many warnings, whether it’s the IE browser or the Nokia mobile phone. No matter how dominant, how much market share you have, if you do not adopt the latest technology and fail to constantly improve on the core user value proposition, time will pass you by. Ultimately, digital asset exchanges around the world can only advocate for the best technology and aim to provide the best trading experience for our clients. <br/><br/>OKCoin will officially enable Ethereum (ETH) deposit and withdrawal services on 22:00, May 31. ETH trading services will be officially available on 12:00, June 1. <br/><br/>We pride ourselves on excellent product and quality customer service. We at OKCoin look forward to continuing to provide you with the best trading products and services. <br/><br/>OKCoin International: +852 - 58085767 <br/>2017 - 5 - 31"

As bitcoin goes global, Bitmain seems to be using this to keep the market from growing too fast. If they can keep big hands from buying and holding. Hmm how to do that.. cause a market crash, rather then holding big money investors sell out of fear of loosing fortunes.  Bitmain creates opportunity for themselves out of fear of a failing market. Really only people who lost out are new adopters of bitcoin.... That&#39;s  mostly big money guys. They don&#39;t want anyone with deeper pockets then them to trust bitcoin. So they can keep buying it up from us little people who like to sell ours regularly back onto the market. Oh yeah BIG Investors don&#39;t buy and sell they buy and hold.  Bitmain under BU rules, do not want big amounts of bitcoin to stay outside the market. This means they wont be earning the potential transaction fees from those large chunks of coin that normally are bought and sold . But I&#39;m foolish?"
493,2017-05-30 08:49:30.967,"Another day and more clarity. Trend is up. Bitfinex is still market leader for the USD. Why do I say that? Because Bitfinex is the only exchange that is producing an independant chart, and it can be read with certainty. The other exchanges are in some way conforming to Bitfinex and to some extent converging to reduce the price gap... which makes their charts harder to read, and also hard to trade, because you risk a random 70-80 USD drop and misrepresentative indicators (Polo is doing alt-trader variation but conforms to Bitfinex too)... Which is one of the reasons why I opted to switch out of flexibility of USD to Euro...<br/><br/>the others being a good price on Bitstamp on €, and international forex temporarily breaking low to help push that through. I got it at a mix of 1,115-1,12, compared to the complete fantasy of 1.18 Bitstamp produced just a few days ago. When USD/€ moves like this, it affects the pairs. So with low liquidity on €, you have the option of stopping out in USD, or doing it in € and taking the hit of price. Both can be really bad, for different reasons (such as doing 6% gains on a trade, only to be stopped out on a similar 6% USD/€ local switch, and fees on top, with spread and slippage, leading to loss on a solid trade). So I am awaiting an opening with a favourable €/USD ratio. In any case, my profits are protected now even if I lost flexibility.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is a clear channel up on Bitfinex. Top line 1810, 2040 to 2249.8. Low line parallel to top: 1950, 2160. Channel is tradeable. I don&#39;t know how long it lasts, but at least there is a clear guide to follow right now, and a way to pick a good entry point of one wants to go long or short."

As it didnt go down 1850 , we may say that it recovered and it started moving around 2100~2200. What now.. Seems that speculative money has gone out first from alts than from btc. and left it around 2100~2200. Without new money in , it can not go up . If this can not go up it goes down , to 1950~2000.  It must gain momentum for reaching 3000&#39;s. It will take some time. Fat fingers could sell more for buying lower. We should not panic in those situations."

511,2017-05-29 06:03:13.127,"The silence is deafening on all CC forums.<br/><br/>The silence reminds me of the silence in a war room, on the first attack, on the first night of the beginning of the first Iraqi war.  No one spoke as we watched it happen.<br/><br/>It was an OH Shit moment, as the TV monitors flashed data, pictures, real time cruise missile launches, B-52, B-1 and other attacks could be watched, in real time.  While satellite real time video showed what was to be a bad day for some poor Iraqi guy with a wife and kids back home who did not want to be there in the first place.<br/><br/>Like @dallycurtis watching Braveheart I cried.  So did most who were with me.  We knew what was going to happen to the men on the ground.<br/><br/>Today, while watching the Crypto depth charts, it reminded me of two armies, lined up against each other in another epic battle.  <br/><br/>One for the survival of Crypto, and the other side who has line after line of coins to sell, at the expense of everyone but themselves. <br/><br/>What is at stake is the fate of Crypto.   <br/>  <br/>Now, at the time of this writing, the Red team has over 3200 LTC to sell at $24.80, creating a massive wall of resistance, yet the Green team keeps sending small Coins, again and again, only to meet the wall, yet, not budge it. The wall just destroyed the Green team and sent the price back over a $1.00.  Still, they come.  Disillusioned, doubting, fearful.<br/><br/>On 31 May, 153 years ago, the Battle of Cold Harbor was fought. Grant said of the battle in his memoirs, &quot;I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made. ... No advantage whatever was gained to compensate for the heavy loss we sustained.&quot;  Grant was not an educated man and I doubt he read the Art of War.<br/><br/>At this time, I invite you to invoke the AOW tactical disposition of defense:  <br/><br/>“The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.  Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; “<br/><br/>The Red team will defeat those who sell or buy aimlessly, shooting their arrows into the abyss, hoping to strike some target, while depleting their resources.  <br/><br/>If there is nothing to sell, and the price drops, they will have no reason to lose money, and slow down.<br/><br/>Also, there is no reason to buy while the fighting is going on. The battlefield is unstable.  What looked good 3 days ago is now an unacceptable position.<br/><br/>“The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth”.<br/>“Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to  defeat first fights, and afterwards looks for victory.”<br/><br/>The Finns used this tactic during the Winter War.  They, in essence lost battles, but won the war.  White Death had a 0-259 kill ratio.  They became invisible when weak, fought only when they could win.  <br/><br/>Crypto is economic war. <br/><br/>So, what to do?<br/><br/>As a group, the CC cryptos can, if you so choose, to not buy any more Crypto spontaneously.  As a group, you can choose not to sell any.<br/>  <br/>I do not know how many of you are out there, nor do I care.  We constitute a block of influence and can choose to do whatever we want.<br/><br/>What we can do is together, allow for a cooling off time, let the other teams fight the dragon while we, collect our FIAT, and get ready for a big buy, at the right time.<br/><br/>Increase our intelligence levels.  Lots of really talented people out there who can provide intel and suggestions.<br/><br/>I do not understand how 75K of sales can go in one block when I have limited allowances per week.  How is that possible?  Is there a MT. Gnox out there we don&#39;t know about??  We need to be like 100 eyes in NETFLIX&#39;s Marco Polo.  Post intel.<br/><br/>Until we can collectively figure out how to go forward, we are just a few stragglers battling consolidated walls of resistance, bots, and who knows. <br/> <br/>“The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege”  Sun Tzu.<br/><br/>Appreciate any comments and ideas.<br/><br/>This is a battle for our economic freedom.<br/><br/>If you agree, say why, If you disagree, say why.  I value your opinions and look forward to reading your ideas to achieve a solution.<br/><br/>Sisu."

Understand that what you have bought into, which is the future of currency. Ignore the graphs and keep the diamonds you have mined precious. Time will show how much they will be in demand.

There is about 160 - 250Bln of Organized Crime proceeds that still will need to be laundered thru cryptocurrencies. For those who understand how money laundering works, they will know to buy and hold. For those who believe this is some game changing technology they are wrong. Tax Evasion, Money Laundering are the fuel of all cryptocurrencies, and you can bet every bit of your bitcoins on this. Once laundered and gains tax is paid on those proceeds, these cryptocurrencies will vanish into thin air and that would forever be the end of it.<br/><br/>EDIT: The logical way of looking at this is, why would anybody need a currency which does the same thing as a credit card does if it is regulated. The main feature of Bitcoin and the only attractive factor is Deregulation and low understanding by Financial Forensics. Once they catch up to how Bitcoin works, and put in regulation demanding that each transaction which came from an online digital currency exchange be audited, it will show you just how much of the organized crime was involved in bitcoin."

541,2017-05-27 17:19:12.267,"Just wanna share what I have experienced on this cryptocurrency and BTC... Initially I come to the world of Crypto by accident... Its started with a video sent by my friend and the video is talking about deep web and how Bitcoin play major roles in deep web on transacting illegal activities...<br/>Then I started my study about Bitcoin and deep web( Darkweb).<br/>I started with opening Remitano Wallet that allow me to buy BTC in my country, then I come to know about cryptocompare.com  and slowly learned about Xapo, Exmo, Spectrocoin, Gatehub, Exodus, and other wallet. Thank You cryptocompare.com<br/>What I try to share is this BTC has make my life easy... Eg: Xapo allow me to get Xapo Bitcoin Debit Card similar to Spectrocoin. I can apply for Debit Card in USD , Pound and Euro.<br/>I do a lot of travelling and spend lot of expenses oversea. Even I have business relationship with company in United Stated. <br/>The benefit of using Xapo Debit Debit Card for payment really make my life easier since the debit card is with Visa or Master similar to bank issue card.<br/>1. Whenever I go I easily swipe the card for all my oversea expenses and immediately know the balance of my BTC. No need for me to exchange fiat money at money changer.<br/>2. I can withdraw cash anywhere I go via ATM machine and no need for me to change lot currency before my  travelling.<br/>3. My supplier oversea also accept payment through debit card with unlimited amount. This save my time to do wire transfer oversea and being question by my govt for money out from my country.<br/>4. Xapo wallet also allow me to create Fiat Currency wallet and if the crash like this I move my BTC to USD easily and move back to BTC when its recover.<br/>5. I also have invested in various Alt Coin eg ETH, LTC, Ripple, Doge, Humaniq, and another one is new ICO. I&#39;m bit lucky cause come to place the money at the price when it not so high like this. The most important thing is I have recover my initial investment because my investment value has multiple a lot since last year.<br/><br/>As a  summary, I feel that Bitcoin and when it link to real life it make my life easier especially when dealing with oversea transactions. It is not just for the sake of investment per say for me. When this come with added value for my life then I think it will also help others like me. Therefore, I would say that it has added value in our life and I belief some business such as fiat money exchange , wastern Union and other related business will be greatly affected in the future."
542,2017-05-27 17:14:04.610,"Following the golden rule of Bitcoin trading, namely that EVERY entry point, except the MOST scary one, MUST be stop hunted, I feel we will need to go down again."
543,2017-05-27 16:42:40.173,"Ok - my first try at an OP - here goes...<br/>I&#39;m trying to get my head around the value of any coin, except for the rarity - i.e. the increased value because everyone wants it - like gold.  I get that part.  BTC was first kid on the block - so massive starter advantage - very popular - this goes a long way as everyone knows.<br/><br/>And I see how privacy would help some of the other coins (Dash, Monero, ZCash, more?...) as drug dealers and arms dealers queue up to hide their cash (I judge nobody). <br/><br/>I can also see how for example Ethereum or RIPPLE could help save shed loads of cash for banks or as smart contracts between individual companies or users - the developers get paid to make these things work so fair play.  But how does that smart crypto fruit actually benefit a holder of the coins?  If I don&#39;t plan to send of receive interbank money, why own XRP? (if the banks even choose to use it anyway).  Is it simply in the hopes that companies and people around the world will want it?  <br/><br/>Which brings me on to the coins that are hoping to replace the money supply - near instant point of sale payments for a coffee is probably possible in the not too distant future.  And I agree if people could do that then the demand for that money supply would be huge.  BUT - do you think any developed big country government is going to allow its citizens to just abandon the countries currency in favour of something that would allow people to avoid taxes?  What do you think pays for all the Business Welfare State? And the wars?<br/><br/>I can see the governments allowing crypto in the beginning to better understand how people might get to know it, but then, there will almost certainly be coins emerging from the bigger countries, possibly based on the established guys now - that allow some measure of limited control over it. Otherwise governments might as well pack up and go home, because no tax = no government.  <br/><br/>And finally, while I&#39;m on a roll, let&#39;s say the UK government AGREED to use, say, DASH coin technology to create their own coin - how does that benefit the current holders of DASH.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re still reading, thanks for persevering.  I&#39;ve had these question since the beginning, which for me was pretty much January, and became the reason to invest in only BTC along with the privacy coins mentioned above.  And then I watched in disbelief as RIPPLE and ETH went through the roof.  I want to know why."

546,2017-05-27 16:03:24.873,"Theory on Bitcoin Manipulation based on facts obtained first hand. <br/><br/>Lets not fool ourselves this massive btc drop off happened right as many first time buyers with deep pockets came into play from all over the world, very strategic timing. So what just happened in with BTC? Its hard to understand at first but what actually took place resulted in  a direct siphon of money to china as their fiat dollar continues to fall. Hmmmm?<br/><br/>Why would I make such claims?<br/>The Chinese already have a monopoly with BTC mining, one would be foolish to think otherwise.<br/>In my mind its nearly certain Bitmain the people who run the largest BTC pool, and the only manufacture of the fastest most efficient asic miner. Bitmain well understands this part of mining better than anyone.  This is why you havent seen antpools has hashrate to double that of the 2nd place pool. and would influence the market to maximize there profit margin. So if this is the case  a number near 50 percent of all new bitminers / newly minted btc would  stay within china.  People need to understand that the flow of newly generated coins into the market is the key. Bitmain is so sure of the rising value it recently stopped accepting USD wire-transfers and is only accepting bitcoin as payment from now on. This recent bubble wouldn&#39;t have been as big or as noticeable &quot;yet&quot; had BU been adopted by the majority community.  A backed up network drives the tx transaction rate up allowing for bitcoin txs to be worth as much as 6-8 bitcoin extra ontop of the 12.5 btc block reward. Since the system was already  backing up they decide to manipulate further ( more on this later) for those panic sellers who need the transactions confirmed asap they would be wiling to pay the highest rates to the miners to confirm their txs first... thus giving Bitmain and the large chinese miners the biggest block reward ive seen under current block size.<br/><br/> Without more time to wait for they initiated there massive sell of new bitcoin and which was at a  time when bitcoin was at new all time high and a the most unconfirmed tickets i have ever seen.. No wonder that all the big chinese btc pool are mining profit with BU and would have stood to profit even more. These manipulations are not as visible, until the network is back logged. Chinese miners waited for all the right things and manipulate the market when btc was at a all time highe.  all they did was wait for for a new difficulty rise coming in a few days with the massive bubble they actually helped pump up. A  massive uptick in new bigmoney investments was the last thing they needed. Bitmain manipulated the market but cutting off a huge percent of newly minted btc. This scarcity created false demand by not only holding the coin, but actually turning off miners. to help the networks transactions back up. <br/><br/>Also know over the past month there was a masssive loss of BTCs hashing power  massive amounts of miners were turned off the to back up the TX transactions, thus resulting in a spike in the amount of money MINERS were making due to a heavily congested network. These people have been dealing with it the longest. <br/><br/>Right as bitcoin was growing at an even faster rate, BOOM the massive influx of new BTC into the system created too much supply and  Immediately sent  BTC  in a downward spiral. As the downturn started the networks hashrate hits a new all time high, with the massive inflation of tx fees from the planned hasrate reduction, and now Bitmain stands to make even more moeny through the high transaction fees. The lack of newly minted bitcoin caused or largely influenced this bubble.. And what would one do with all this bitcoin, sell it at the most opportune time when the exchange rate is at an all time high.  All those newly minted bitcoin dropping into the the market Caused panic  Now the Market drops the Chinese fiat grows massively against BTC. So now their currency in less then  2 days can buy heir paper currency. They buy back in when they have the highest conversion rate to their currency. DONE  They made money on both the selling bitcoin and the downturn and repurchase. All caused by selling so many freshly minted/never before traded bitcoin into a market that has been going up on false scarcity.<br/><br/>Also know over the past month there was a masssive loss of BTCs hashing power  massive amounts of miners were turned off the to back up the TX transactions, thus resulting in a spike in the amount of money MINERS were making due to a heavily congested network. These people have been dealing with it the longest and knew exactly how to manipulate it to benefit them the most.  More transaction clogging the network the higher the rate anyone is willing to pay to have their transaction a priority.<br/><br/>Summary<br/> The size of this bubble was also directly influenced by big Chinese miners collaborating in a number of ways to profit the most off their dying currency and bitcoin.<br/>bitcoins network hashing rate fell...  over 500P/h  for a brief period directly coinciding with a difficulty increase. <br/>Those 500P/h still account for over 10 percent of the entire networks rate . <br/>Fast forward  the difficulty rose they they put there plan into action massive new bitcoin sales hit... so everyone else mining actually takes a difficulty spike alongside the with the 10% hashrate spike on the network and the downward spiral that ensued.  All of which I believe was  planned perfectly, end eventually caused the misfortune of many holding BTC . <br/> This was done so bitmain  would profit the most and stay supreme as the top dog mining.  <br/>Massive amounts of miners were turned back on in a very short time on  a heavily congested network overpriced  tx fees. These people have been dealing with Bitcoin buying and trading the longest, which is  why I am certain they manipulated it the networks mining fees, and either manipulated price of bitcoin though good old supply and demand, or worse they were the cause of the bubble itself.<br/><br/>Also know over the past month there was a masssive loss of BTCs hashing power  massive amounts of miners were turned off the to back up the TX transactions, thus resulting in a spike in the amount of money MINERS were making due to a heavily congested network.

It is a consequence of the 3rd consecutive rejection of re-entering the floor of the channel we have been following up for the last couple of days.<br/><br/>Bear channel: Take any of the top 3 USD exchanges, and it is easy to identify. Draw a line on the 15 min range on the recent tops, and then another on the two latest lows (bitstamp 2330 and 2256). You should be able to see a steep channel down, that is narrowing slightly. If it holds, then it will take us to the last lowest low no later than in 7 hours. If that support level breaks 2K coins are in play...

After we are done, I will reset local caching on the portfolios as any coins added in the past 4 hours will not have the correct buy price converted. I will do this after the histo data is rebuilt.

702,2017-05-21 22:01:43.363,"New portfolio update.<br/><br/>I got excited about the price movement last night and decided to start working on the collapsible portfolio feature. It is now live and hopefully bug-free?:) (Sorry about the small downtime... I managed to push a few bugs with my first try)<br/><br/>I also added a lot of hover info and added a 1 week period on the portfolio chart.<br/><br/>For example, if you hover over the top stats you get the full numbers.<br/>If you hover over the Total Value next to each coin in the portfolio you get your total investment value. Same works for the collapsed view.<br/><br/>Now the exciting bit, the collapsed view. It combines all your open positions and averages the entry price. If you bought in different currencies it just averages the entry price in the portfolio currency. The amount is the sum of all the coins you have and the price next to it is the weighted average entry position. The price is the current price of the Coin - Portfolio currency pair. The total is the total current worth of all your open positions in the coin. If you hover over the total, you see the total investment. The profit is the sum of all profits and the % change is the profit/investment * 100.<br/><br/>I have also done some optimizations and bug fixes around the data loading. You should now see the value of the portfolio straight away and not a few ms after the loading screen disappears. <br/><br/>If you hover over the total open positions (just under the coin name) you will get a list of buy dates. On the sold side, you get a list of sold dates. I&#39;ve also put on the small pct change next to the current price a small title to explain it&#39;s the 24h % change (we had a few questions about it).<br/><br/>For now, I have disabled editing and selling in the collapsed view until I come up with some sort of interface to ask you which position you want to sell or edit. Another option would be to sell automatically a bit of each but not sure if that is intended behavior. You could have some BTC in a wallet, one on an exchange, one on another and maybe some more in a different wallet.... you need to know which one you are selling.<br/><br/>I&#39;ll get Kanopt (aka Antonio) to do a guide that explains how all of this works and in the next update, I&#39;ll try to find a clever way to link to guides for each section of the portfolio.<br/><br/>As always, let me know in the comments here if you find any bugs or if I broke anything else (might be the case as I&#39;ve spent the last 20 hours working on it - not complaining as the price was going up so I would have probably looked at it anyway).<br/><br/>https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/1383280/portfolio-collapsed.png"

It means higher industrial commodity and energy costs which will manifest themselves through rising price inflation of goods and services for the average american Joe.  Rising inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates. Higher base rates mean higher mortgages, higher insurance premiums, higher credit card charges and higher everything you can think of that bears interest.

791,2017-05-15 02:37:09.857,"Cryptocurrency has the same problem Bernie Sanders had when he ran for president in 2016.  This is not a commentary or endorsement of him, just an invitation for you to consider, below.<br/><br/>During the 2016 Presidential campaign, everyone was talking about &quot;I am with Her&quot; and &quot;the Donald&quot;.  I listened to them and noticed that no one mentioned Bernie Sanders.  So, I decided to take my own poll.  I asked over 1000 people if they heard of Bernie Sanders.<br/> Although what I did, can be considered an “Antidotal”, non-scientific poll,  the results were astounding.  9 out of 10 people said, “Bernie Sanders”?.  Who is he?<br/><br/>It was easy to conclude that the MSM were ignoring him, as they are with CryptoCurrencies.  The establishment just does not want to let anyone to know that there is an alternative to Dead Money savings accounts, loss of Savings at 2% = 50% reduction in value @ 10 years etc. Stock market is fraudulent…… and your government prints money without any backing, every day.<br/><br/>I took my own poll, asking everyone I met, over the last 30 days, amounting to over 500 people, if they heard about Bitcoin.  Again, the results are astounding.  85% said “Bitcoin, what is that?”.  Out of the 15% who said yes, I asked what do you know about it, they all said either, “drug dealers use it”, or that is was “an unstable Ponzi scheme”.  No one owned a Bitcoin, nor did they intend to.<br/><br/>My point is this:  Crypto cannot succeed without us implementing the Hundreth monkey effect.  We must train and educate enough people for the Crypto Coin effect to take off now, not by 2030.  <br/><br/>What to do:<br/>1.	People are not aware of Crypto.  Why, data not &quot;pushed&quot; via establishment propaganda channels.<br/>2.	We need more investors in Crypto, not just a fringe group due to the limited funds of the few that are in Crypto vs the population sitting on trillions in Dead Money savings accounts.<br/>3.	We must educate as many people as possible about Crypto, and turn them into investors or what ever terminology you want to use to describe them.<br/><br/>How to do?:  Tell everyone.  Many of you are already doing that.  Kudo’s.  Lurkers need to get active.  <br/><br/>Example:  4K of Cryptonites X 1 person a week X 52 weeks = 208K more investors.  Tell them to go to<br/> https://www.cryptocompare.com and educate them. <br/><br/>The growth potential from just 4K investors to 208K is a 5200% increase in one year.  Imagine what that may extrapolate to in increased Crypto value, stability, acceptance.  Let&#39;s make this phenomenon even more exponential/Logarithmic!<br/><br/>Already have the wife and daughter on board along with 4 more this week alone.  Next are my 4 friends on FB.  Joke.  And I show the web site to all the people I see every week.  <br/><br/>A Grass Roots campaign is needed by all Cryptonites, and I will do my part, to make all of us successful in this endeavor. Crypto is a community.  Let’s invest in our friends, family, and strangers to grow our community.  Each person you bring in will earn you 1BTC Karma points for helping others become more financially secure.  Nothing is more rewarding than helping people.  Nothing.<br/><br/>Make no promises.  Just facts.  Let them decide if they want to be a part of one of the fastest growing paradigm regarding money,  in the world today.<br/><br/>I will never forget the uncomfortableness of my wife and I traveling to Brazil with $9,999.00 cash, each of us, to do some import export business, three times.  It was impossible for us to wire it beforehand.  Next trip we will use Bitcoin transfers via our Iphones.  Let&#39;s end this madness.<br/><br/>Can we do this??<br/><br/>Sisu."

826,2017-05-12 18:28:19.280,"Another Go For The Bitcoin ETF<br/>A lot of people are surprised to learn the SEC is not fully giving up on the concept of a bitcoin ETF just yet. Although the BATS rule change proposal was rejected in march of 2017. The institution will take a second look at the proposal. This is thanks to the Bats BZX exchange team filing a petition for a ruling review, which has now been approved by the SEC. That is quite interesting, as the SEC could easily reject this petition as well.<br/><br/>Now that the petition has been approved, the SEC is looking for further comments on the Bats rule change proposal. Any input is welcome until May 15th. It is doubtful the SEC will suddenly approve the rule proposal change, though, but this goes to show the idea of a major publicly traded bitcoin ETF is not out of the question just yet. Moreover, this news may have a positive effect on the bitcoin price as well, even though a second rejection will probably send it crashing hard, just like it did in March.<br/><br/>The Winklevoss twins are quite excited about the news, although they are not getting their hopes up just yet. One has to be realistic about the chance of the SEC suddenly approving the Bats rule change proposal, which still remains slim to none. At the time of the rejection, the SEC referred to the lack of market surveillance and regulation, which makes bitcoin an asset that does not qualify for the standards to be part of a publicly traded ETF.<br/><br/>Very little has changed ever since that time, though, making it virtually impossible to see the SEC suddenly approve the Bats proposal. While it is good the organization has approved the review of the rejection, there is no reason to think things will play out any differently in the coming weeks. There will be a lot of hope surrounding the review process, while the end result will most likely be the same yet again. If that rejection is confirmed, it is not unlikely we will see sub-US$1,000 bitcoin prices once again in the coming weeks."

Since that date, they have had a volume on the USD/BTC pair of about 350K-400K. Which means that every single coin on the exchange has been traded 4+ times in the last 3 weeks. And that is EXCLUDING every other BTC pair, such as LTC, ETC, ETH. If those have to be added, then the circulation is even faster. If there are any hodlers on the exchange debating to leave or waiting for a better price, then the coins AGAIN have to circulate even faster.<br/><br/>This can only mean two things, where either one or both are true. BTC coins are held for an extremely short amount of time and are sold at very small profit margins again and again and again, OR coins that do not exist are somehow in circulation on the exchange."
841,2017-05-11 19:41:35.547,"I invite all forum readers to read this post.  <br/>Everyone is wondering about what is going to happen next.  The future of Cryptocurrencies is dependent on many factors.  So, let’s just list a few, and I will depend on all of you to suggest additional factors.  <br/>The purpose of this exercise is to convey, to everyone, the futility of accurate predictions, based on scientific principles, not lemming appealing “opinions”.  People ask me all the time what my opinion is of something and my answer is, I have no opinion, just data.<br/>Here are some of the factors we, the Crypto community needs to consider:<br/>1.	 What countries are attempting to stop or are attempting to use Crypto?  What impact does each country have, positive or negative to this equation? Example Russia Vs. China Vs. Mexico.  What impact weight do we give each country?<br/>2.	What NGOs are attempting to stop or are attempting to use Crypto?  What impact does each NGO have, positive or negative to this equation?  What impact weight do we give each NGO?<br/>3.	What Banking systems are attempting to stop or are attempting to use Crypto?  What impact does each system have, positive or negative to this equation?  USAA Vs. Citi.<br/>4.	What Stealth Financial organizations such as the Federal Reserve and Reserve banks, the Rothschild influences, Winklevoss initiatives etc., in other countries are attempting to stop or are attempting to use Crypto?  What impact does each entity have, positive or negative to this equation?<br/>5.	Impact of inflation, recession, depression, debt load, political disruptions, wars have, for each country in the world, have on this equation?<br/>6.	The true value of Fiat currency not backed by gold or anything else, and the constant printing of money by almost all countries Vs. the limited number of Crypto coins produced Vs. the fiat used to buy these coins.<br/>7.	The economic impact of transfer of the value of the “dead cash” in institutional savings accounts into Crypto.<br/>8.	The administration of Crypto done by mathematical geniuses (thanks Vitalik Buterin and others) who are not business people, who need to consider, cost benefit ratios of mining, administration, the obscene cost of transactions by traders, etc.,….. to reduce non-value added parasitic losses to Crypto owners.<br/>9.	Regulatory or Nonregulatory policies in each country and bank that imposes either limitations, taxes, or restrictions on Crypto flow, into and out of Fiat monies.  <br/>10.	Infrastructure stability to insure mining, administration, internet, etc, is available to meet the demand.<br/><br/>Here are just 10 issues not addressed by the community, blogs, most self-described Crypto “Guru’s on YouTube, Crypto web sites, and the world in general.  There are many more, and I will spare you the pain.  These are the issues I think about and you are asking about.  No real answers tho……<br/><br/>Reporting that Crypto has reached a new high Market Cap or is now at $1876 per X-coin is not an analysis.  An analysis is to take the data and formulate it into a cogent direction in which everyone can understand.  Use the Occam’s razor example.  The simplest answer is the best.  Simply stating that BTX, for example is going to be $500,000 per coin, without analytical substance or explanation is click bait bullshit that helps no one to make a proper decision.  I remember everyone was using $2000 by September…We are now $200 dollars from that level and September is 133 days away.  <br/><br/>If each issue has 10 variables, times the 10 issues, the realm of possibilities is 10 to the 10th power.  That gives us 10 billion possibilities as to the future of Crypto.  <br/><br/>Which possibility do you chose? <br/><br/>Now, while we are at it, let’s give a big thanks to the guys and gals, who run this web site.  Love their Portfolio system.  Needs tweaking and I am confident they will continue to improve it so they can get paid for their work.  The portfolio is a value added system.

You can see how almost all cryptos remain the same in value over the USD, but as the BTC is rising up, their value over BTC is going down. BTC is almost getting into a psychological resistance ($1,900 - $2,000), so maybe selling to buy other cryptos now or when it reaches $1,900 at least would be a good idea.<br/><br/>LTC is the only one who dropped aggressively against the USD. Maybe because SegWit wasn&#39;t really necessary as a competitive skill against BTC. They were far more faster than BTC, now they are SUPER FAST, but LTC doesn&#39;t have any real use at the moment. Bummer. <br/><br/>Giving away just my two cents of thought. I&#39;m no expert."

856,2017-05-11 05:59:13.477,"So far, most forum posts have been somewhat &quot;empty&quot;. I really looked for some intel here and only 10% of the posts provided real INTEL. I apologize in advance, and now for the rant.<br/><br/>BCX is now $1840 on GDAX. Overall, market cap is growing which shows that people are not getting out so much as just shifting their money around like lemmings following other really stupid lemmings. That just gives the exchanges a lot more money in their pocket due to obscene charges, volatility of the market, and provokes the &quot;fear&quot; holders of Crypto to sell and hide somewhere else. This is beyond idiocracy. &quot;Need more electrolytes man......&quot; Like what exactly does it really cost to process a transaction? Check it out. Miners fees and transaction fees are the bane of Crypto. Do Segwit now. Listen to the Russian kid. He has got some brains for sure... <br/><br/>Also, the exchanges are not yet properly equipped to handle all this volume. Kraken and Coinbase are good examples of poor IT management in which they are incapable of handling all this volume. I do not buy the denial of service excuses. They were failing way before the alleged DOS occurred. Their systems are not even synchronized as they all show massive divergent in pricing and value. They need to fire their IT idiots just like the fearless orange leader fired some other people that worked for him because they did not do their jobs. No one who provides any real Crypto analysis dares criticize the &quot;Exchanges&quot; for fear that they will lose their coins. Most &quot;analysis&quot; posts on our esteemed Crypto web sites are fluff jobs done by high school equivalent &quot;journalists&quot;. No facts, no real analysis, just friggin charts that make no sense to anyone to include people who actually have 4 college degrees. Total paska. W/o no explanation as to how someone comes up with an analysis, it is worthless. Just noise. <br/><br/>This is exactly why previous posts saying &quot;DIVERSIFY&quot; are valid. How stable is a one legged stool? Pick the top three stable Cryptos you feel good about and stick with them. <br/><br/>Remember that when you buy Crypto, it should be money you can lose forever. If you are skint, have a lot of fear, don&#39;t believe in Crypto being the currency of the future, you don&#39;t belong here.<br/><br/>We need to get rid of the chain that the banksters have placed around our necks. They make billions in international transfers. Cryptos give us the ability to allow people to send money to their families without the 1% taking their unfair share. This is not only an investment in getting rid of the banks that give you 0% interest on your cash in the bank, but charge you 21% for your credit card debt. This is about making a statement, enough is enough. <br/><br/>Crypto is yours. Own it. They only want to ruin it. Buy......buy... buy... <br/><br/>Have no fear.<br/><br/>P.S. Most Youtube analysts suck. Watch with extreme caution. The Russian guy is good tho. They are out of control just trying to get likes. Rant completed, blockchain completed."

The offering will be a first for the country, and will enable Bitcoin holders to deposit their digital currency in fixed deposit accounts that earn interest at one of four different rates ranging from one to five percent.<br/>According to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review, customers who commit to depositing Bitcoin for 14 days can earn interest at a 1% annual rate. That rate of interest rises to 2% for currency deposited for 30 days, 3% for 90-day deposits, and 5% for deposits held for an entire year. The article notes that hundreds of thousands of citizens in Japan are believed to be holding Bitcoin. If true, then there is almost certainly a market for these types of accounts.<br/>That report also notes that the country’s Financial Services Agency has said that this new deposit service would not be subject to Japan’s banking regulations. While Japan has formally recognized digital currency, it has yet to be designated as legal tender, so those monetary regulations do not apply. However, as the Nikkei report acknowledges,"
873,2017-05-10 07:53:26.580,"Capital markets deal with long term investments, that is to say, money in the market is expected for a longer period of time, usually for timeframes longer than one year. Like any investment though, this market can be risky which is why governments and financial systems enforce preliminary controls, referred to as capital controls that will not only protect financial systems from taking too much risk, but will also level the ground for traders in a way that the trade is made fair for all. This is important because with a lot of fraudulent systems cropping up dealing in these areas, controls will give traders and financial institutions a sense of security for their investments. It is gives you sort of an assurance that when you invest your money into the capital market, you will stand to gain in due time.

885,2017-05-09 12:09:38.793,The reason BTC is up and alts are down is that there are a lot of gamblers  that play the lottery on alts. as they  can make the largest gain. then if it drops people get scared  and sell for BTtC. when alts are crashing even more people are getting scared and try to sell there alts as soon as possible. this all ends up in BTC. Then they either sell to FIAT or sit on the BTC as it is still rising.<br/>Then when the storm calms and the investors step in in the really cheap alts. alts start to rise again and BTC drops as people convert back to alts or sell to FIAT as BTC starts to drop.<br/>A very predictable pattern. <br/>So I would say  buy alts now or in the next 1~2 days as they are cheap and sell or convert the BTC in the same timeframe

915,2017-05-07 13:17:02.027,hi .... i was inspired at the concept of btc back in 2013 but was anxious about the criminal association so lacking balls i left it alone . back in march i stopped crying and spent 500e to receive my first bit of a bitcoin . so I&#39;ve to date I&#39;ve invested 1500E the value of that has neaely doubled in less than 2 months...... if somethings to good to be true it usually is ..... can this be real ? i havnt logged out of cryptocompare since january im obsessed ... www.facebook.com/wyrdwoods   is what i do . i have no property or inheratance      on the horizon .. thanks  for this site  its invaluable... so the question is do i scrap up every penny i can get and go all in even though this must be a bubble or take my 1500E profit treat the kids and be greatfull........

I just want to make money as I dont have a need to use alt coin to make purchases. So as others have said before the chnages in bitcoin is really tiny compare to other currency whihc cost a fraction of the price. therefore, in order for me to make money i decided to move my bitcoins to cheaper coins to get more movements. Now, it doesnt mean that i will make money but if I do it&#39;ll be much more than what I wouldve eith bitcoin but when i lose its usually much higher too... it a gamble worth taking for me as I genuinly believe that those other coins will move upward sooner or later if they are not already..."

And while I am utterly convinced that BTC is massively overbought, this is a classic formation. Confirmation is likely to hit Bitstamp (my exchange) first. Return on profit target is the worst of all three exchanges. And there are no bids of reasonable size around the pattern confirmation point in €. Trading to USD is like taking an instant 50% hit on your stop loss. So, not tradable for me. Risk is not proportional with reward. <br/><br/>But if you can get confirmation on Gdax/Bitfinex, you can make a quick smash and grab. You have about 5 minutes to consider this before confirmation hits, and you need to calculate position size and risk management. If you are up to the challenge, get thinking. I cannot due to my local situation.<br/><br/>Edit: Coinbase/Gdax is lagging the most, so there you have the luxury of using the other two exchanges as indicators. <br/><br/>As usual, there are no such things as safe bets.

1001,2017-04-27 23:28:11.363,"I originally diversified my investments in crypto (BTC, LTC, ETH, and Ripple), precious metals, and mining stocks.  Watching the bullish market for crypto seriously makes me want to cash out of the over-manipulated stock market, and just put the rest into the cryptos.  I always get a kick out of the mainstream news saying this is a speculative investment, yet more countries are adopting it as legal currency, such as Japan.  BTC might dip after this, but it&#39;s still quite bullish, definitely past the value of gold.  <br/><br/>At some point, I think the US stock market bubble is going to pop, and if physical metals run out, I think people will be transferring their fiat currency into crypto to fight inflation.  The more I sit back and watch, the more I seriously consider Bitcoin, and the blockchain in general, a once in a century creation.  It&#39;s been an amazing ride, and let the doubters doubt, because when it goes past $1500 to $2000, you will hear those same people complain about how they should have hopped in.  Hold strong, you might just get more surprises, soon enough.<br/><br/>By the way, I now have BTC in my retirement account, so I&#39;m definitely going long, and will hopefully look back on this with a smile, same for you guys."

1030,2017-04-24 13:43:22.977,"So now we are at an interesting place.  When the price goes up at Bitfinex, there is no corresponding withdrawal of BTC from the exchange. Hence purchasing of BTC and driving up the price has trading objectives as a purpose and not flight. We have had at least 3 attempts from Coinbase, Gemini and BItstamp to dethrone Bitfinex as market leader for USD, where price could move independently from Bitfinex. This has been met with partial success. By that I mean that we have had dislodgement of price from Bitfinex, but insane walls on all three exchanges have moved them back into place.<br/><br/>This leads to the conclusion, that there is obsolutlely no reason at ALL to regard the current price for BTC as based on market supply and demand dynamics. Bitfinex is driving up price without any condition of panic, knowing well that it drives other exchanges up. When those exchanges try to break away, they are propped up by buy walls. Someone is making a killing from this."

Remember, BTC and the other cryptos are still in the beginning stages, and are just now slowly becoming more talked about in various countries.  From my research, if we do go through another recession, or economic crisis of sorts BTC will be used along with gold, and silver as a safe haven against inflation, not only as an investment.<br/><br/>Think about it, gold and silver is already being accrued and hoarded by Russia, China, and other countries, including in Europe.  At some point, not if, but when the manipulation stops on these markets, the price should go up.  Well, being traditional hedges, the physical supply might run out, and more and more people would turn to BTC, and other cryptos.  Just an interesting thought experiment, and a potential scenario in the near future.<br/><br/>For myself, I just keep accruing, and buy on the dips.  The future is bright for BTC and crypto; regardless of the hard fork debacle."

Either banking connections (with new AML scrutiny) outside of Taiwan have to be developed, or the Taiwanese banks have to be cleared again for USD AML -  the latter will take months and is entirely outside of the control of any crypto exchange.<br/><br/>My own perspective - nothing is mentioned of Tether, and why this is likely to be a wild card for Bitfinex in this process. If you do not understand why, then wiki &quot;Liberty Reserve&quot;. Article assumes Bitfinex is solvent - I have nothing to say otherwise.

The deposit wave stops, because price stabilized around fundamental value and began to climb up again. Then you get another deposit wave from the 24th, in tandem with the second sell off wave,  to the 26nd, presumably because there was some worry as if there would be a third leg down.<br/><br/>Then things become interesting. The first report of USD withdrawal rejection comes around the 23rd/24th. Since the 27th, there has been a constant withdrawal of BTC from Bitfinex in TANDEM with price rising. If you inspect total transactions on the chain, then you can see, that this is happening when the amount of transactions total for BTC are going DOWN and are actually at a really LOW level. So while the rest of the network is not moving coins, people on Bitfinex ARE! The more coins they move OFF the exchange, the more price rises for BTC!<br/><br/>Since Bitfinex is market leader for USD, then price rises on all exchanges, even though no one knows why, and to many people&#39;s amazement, this happens without any serious pullback. We have one of the strongest and quickest rallies in BTC history, right after the 5th most serious tumble in BTC history.... and no one knows why.<br/><br/>Now we know. It was people that could not get USD out of Bitfinex. And since nobody really knew this was the reason for the rally, everyone jumped in, even though we should have had a least a couple of weeks bear or sideways.<br/><br/>As I said all along this rally, fundamental price is below 1000 USD. Speculation outlook is not positive. There is no reason for BTC to be above 1050 max. But we are. And now we know why."

Bitcoin&#39;s user network grew from 120,000 users in 2013 to 6.5 million users in 2017, or about 54x, and this could be just the beginning. Growth of that magnitude would produce 400 million users in 2030.<br/>The average value of bitcoin held per user hits $25,000. &quot;As institutional investor cash in Bitcoin, sophisticated investors trading Bitcoin, and Bitcoin-based ETFs proliferate, we think the average Bitcoin value held will increase to around $25k per Bitcoin holder,&quot; Liew and Smith said. Currently, with a market cap of $16.4 billion, and 6.5 million user count, the average user holds $2,515 worth of bitcoin. <br/>Bitcoin&#39;s 2030 market cap is decided by number of bitcoin holders multiplied by average bitcoin value held.<br/>Bitcoin&#39;s 2030 supply will be about 20 million.<br/>Bitcoin&#39;s 2030 price and user count total $500,000 and 400 million, respectively.

1175,2017-04-06 07:44:51.703,"So if you are confused about the latest development in the Core/BU conflict, and why it lead to a price jump, here is the jist of what is going on.<br/><br/>Maxwell from core posted that a certain manipulation of Proof of Work was built into a certain mining hardware, and this is covert to the rest of the network and community. Hence those that own that hardware factory and have a private mining pool are enjoying a substantial boost in mining profits compared to all other miners. Segwit would block that (actually a lot of protocol changes would block it), thus the &quot;inexplicable&quot; resistance to Cores roadmap from &quot;certain parties&quot;.<br/><br/>Debate exploded all over the community. The allegation is of course thinly veiled. Jihan has been cheating with the asics his company makes, and has held that advantage to himself and his pool alone. Thus he is against Core for centralized monopoly profit, and BU is a filibuster, and his allies are tools that are being screwed by their leader.<br/><br/>The trail of proof is documented here, in the following tweet, which is also commented on by the patent holder of the method:<br/><br/>https://twitter.com/AaronvanW/status/849751522472861696<br/><br/>As you can see, there are some problems with the claim. The first problem is the fact, that the method is patented and is not on Jihan&#39;s hands. But not to worry, there are posts out there, that show that Jihan has a patent submitted for China for something similar. Since that would probably cover China and defy the original patent there, then we are on track right?<br/><br/>IMHO, NO.... not at all.<br/><br/>The first problem that I see with this story is the documetation. As can be seen from the tweet trail, it involves reverse engineering an ASIC from said company. There are problems in this. First, that ASIC had to be procured long before the drop mid March to be investigated. This means when Core blow the alarm that led to the crash to 888 USD, they had this hardware and it was already submitted to re-engineering, and they probably already had the results. Why do I say this? Well, the newest BIP has code in it to reveal covert ASIC BOOST if used. Hence it does not block it, it just shows if the miner is using said covert boosting. Thus could NOT have been done in 2-3 weeks. It is simply impossible. Which means, this &quot;reveal&quot; was PLANNED by Core well BEFORE the crash!<br/><br/>Also worthy of note, Maxwell never presents the report of this retro-engineering, nor independant research that confirms the findings. He also DOES NOT mention Bitmain nor Jihan. The reader is left to guess... which I read as Maxwell not being willing to put lawyers and lawsuits where his mouth is. Which he should given the fact that analysis of the digital trail of the 40.000 anonymous challenge to Ver to put his money where his mouth was (in a very unfair challenge if you understand the math), showed that it was HIM that made that challenge. Furthermore, it was not more than a few days ago, that Core began to rattle the sword about changing the rules of POW to lock out certain ASICS, which sent BitFury into the red zone threatening lawsuits. Of course, it was preparation for this and targetting BitMain, which they just won&#39;t say open, but which everyone infers.<br/><br/>There are two more things that I find very weird about this narrative. Jihan signed off on the Hong Kong agreement. That would have given Segwit in mere months. He did NOT abandon this agreement, Core did when they said none of those they had sent to negotiate and sign could represent Core. So Jihan deliberately based his production of ASICS and his mining pool on a secret advantage, that he wanted to keep for himself for as long as possible, and then signs an agreement to throw all that AWAY in months, and does not break that agreement? That does not make sense!<br/><br/>Furthermore, if his hardware gives every miner 20-30% more hashrate with the activation of a switch, then why hasn&#39;t all the mining pools that support BU activated it and sent the HF in motion? It certainly could push the support over 51% Jihan has this but doesn&#39;t use it... of course.<br/><br/>And lastly, this is being sold as NEWS.... which it ISN&#39;T! Core threatened to HARDFORK over it a year ago! This is OLD NEWS!!!<br/><br/>https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-core-threatens-hard-fork-asicboost-mining-optimization/<br/><br/>Since Core threatened to Hardfork over it, then they have known for over a year, that THIS is not news. They KNOW that the method is old, that they didn&#39;t patch it, because it is debateble if it is a cheat at ALL, even though it is now being labelled as &quot;an exploit&quot; and &quot;an attack on the blockchain&quot;.<br/><br/>I will say this.... THIS is a preplanned media attack. There is no way Core didn&#39;t know they would throw this spin out into the community AFTER they triggered the crash. And the community is eating it up like chowder. Because Core have understood one thing. If you make the price drop, people will hate whoever is to blame, even if YOU bring the news. And if you make the price go UP people will love you. And then it doesn&#39;t matter if you speak the truth, or if what you are doing is hurtful or helpful to Bitcoin. Price alone will determine if they support you....<br/><br/>And this is most bizarre thing of all. This an attack on miners. That earn their money based on BTC price. So all the anger, and the support for Core, ensures the miners are making even MORE money. I am sure the BU miners will be angry with Jihan for this, lol!!!<br/><br/>More than ever, I think we are set for a hardfork. In fact, I think Core internally agreed to and planned for a hardfork when they ditched the Hong Kong agreement. What we are seeing now is not the fight to STOP a hardfork. It is the fight for the coin that will have the most support when it happens."

1192,2017-04-03 04:21:56.837,"We are now less than 200 USD from PEAK fomo false ETF approval price. And there is NOTHING to indicate that we are stopping the current rocket any time soon. The best price indicator for the last 2 years says BTC is worth just below 1000 USD. This IS an aggregate indicator that has held true for over a year.<br/><br/>Unique identities are DOWN, meaning we we are NOT getting new players, and we are NOT getting new money. Transactions are DOWN meaning we have no hodling, and purchasing of bitcoin does NOT leave exchanges, which means it doesn&#39;t enter the eco-system (=it&#39;s going into zero-sum game alts) - 7 day average shows transactions to be at the level of NOVEMBER 2016! This means purchase of BTC is not for &quot;storage of value&quot; nor is it for &quot;use cases&quot;, nor is it for ecosystem demand!<br/><br/>The price increase is speculative and unsupported. Average bitcoin days destroyed peaked just a few days ago, meaning we have had RECORD hodling sell-offs. Long term hodlers are your safety net in sell offs. THEY are the support levels when sh!t gets bad, And they sold out. Not that I disagree, the bad thing is that they sold at 970-888, instead of waiting for this pump to sell. But apart from that, I understand why they sold.<br/><br/>Miner fees are at steady levels, which means BTU has no reason to see internal rebellion, and they can add to their already stupidly large war chests (a medium sized  mining pool recently revealed they had a 100 mill USD war chest ready to go) which also means that there is NO reason for scaling  compromise in the near future.... and since scaling compromise on FUNDAMENTALS would take us to 1450-1550 within weeks (and without it for sure should cap price at 1000 usd for sane people), then WHY are we here when that is NOT on the cards. Remember Segwit requires 95% support, and BTU people have sworn not to back down! <br/><br/>If ANY of you have BTC contacts from 2013, then ask them, if it was so, that ALTS went crazy at the peak, just before everything tanked. They will tell you, that is exactly what happened back then. This is not to say that you should sell everything everywhere now. What you need to do is to manage your risk towards a position that offers QUICK liquidity! Because once this thing pops, you are screwed on the liquidity if you are not in ETH or BTC. So everywhere you go, make sure that you can RUN fast into ETH or BTC. If not, you will be trapped... for years, forever, or for loss!<br/><br/>Investor interest disclosure: I do not hold any cryptocurrency at the moment. The last position I held in any crypto was briefly @ 1060 leading up to the ETF hype. With the current market developments, I am NOT looking into getting ANY crypto at ALL. What I am hoping is the Bitstamp provides margin trading in Q2, as promised, so I can short the crap out of this bubble. I will hate doing it, but I will take the profits nonetheless."
1193,2017-04-03 03:58:54.890,"@cenkg<br/><br/>So the 1D EMA flipped into the positive and we got a 30+ USD pump, exactly as I told you would happen. This is reality now, even though the market did everything it could to tell you, that the 1h and 2h would break down. The market manipulators CANNOT dictate price, but they ARE able to NUDGE at crucial moments to make you believe something, and on the other hand to encourage a trend. Big players CANNOT dictate a trend. They can at the most hold it for a couple of weeks. For it to be profitable in a BIG way to short the market on futures, price HAS to go UP a long way to the point where most traders want to go LONG on futures on OKCoin, Obviously the reverse pattern is also profitable! The name of the game is to trigger MARGIN CALLS!<br/><br/>BTC price eventually always looks to correct in the direction of maximum pain on the futures. However, DO NOT just look at the futures elite sentiment index on OKCoin. Follow position size on Whalecalls. NOTE price points for increase and decrease of position! For instance, look at what happened near the bottom, where Friday rolled over on the drop, and as soon as it was clear that price would break Friday 9Am price on the quarterlies, we had a sell off not only on SPOT, but of OPEN interest on futures. A clear example of how futures traders betting short sold of spot to close shorts on profit, BEFORE spot would kill their position.<br/><br/>It is of no use to you to know that 60% of the elite index is long at price 1160, if they went long at 950! So you need to know WHEN top traders increase and decrease position size.... oddly enough the top 3 traders almost always act in the same hour... which just tells me that they are all OKCoin sub accounts.<br/> <br/>These patterns are what you need to look at to trade in profit on short term market manipulation. You can find the same pattern in the previous week if you compare spot movement, price points and when futures positions are closed. Also, these moves do NOT always pan out. Sometimes they fail, and in some weeks the big players in futures game are in opposition to each other. So there IS a market risk, which means these manipulations are also fallible indicators."
1194,2017-04-03 02:32:17.260,"So...<br/><br/>To all you people that think that BTU is DAO.... look at all the sh!tcoins that have pumped 100-1000% over the last couple of weeks. Sh!tcoins that have absolutely NO usage anywhere in the world. Sh!tcoins that have ZERO demand from an ecosystem. Shitcoins that have questionable coding and security, and in some cases do not even have deflationary value. Shitcoins that have no parent brand value to leech off.<br/><br/>This has been going on since just before the denial of the ETF for BTC. While you can point to Bitcoin Unlimited and point to the very REAL problem of miner specialization, especially with dedicated hardware and mass concentration, and to lower quality of code, you ABSOLUTELY CANNOT write off BTU based on these issues.<br/><br/>If the current alt pump has shown us anything, it is that cryptoworld will pump and buy ANYTHING that has the slightest promise of making you rich. BTU will be no different, ESPECIALLY because the monies that are backing it, and are willing to pump BTU and dump BCC are just staggering. Do your research. Look at the people that have already in public committed to doing this and what they own in BTC.<br/><br/>Maybe BTU in a hardfork won&#39;t win after 2-3 years... But DAO? You have got to be joking. The undervalued coin is the coin that has the best chance of making you rich QUICK....<br/><br/>If several BILLION USD are willing to LEAVE BTC to go into shitcoins over the timepan of just one month, in the face of ETF disappointment, BTU has a very, very bright future after a hardfork."

This is a new form of money created on the basis of the program code.<br/>Bitcoin is not owned by any state, companies or individuals.<br/>Due to this, Bitcoin has become the world&#39;s first decentralized means of payment. Money transfers are made on the peer-to-peer principle — without intermediaries between the sender and the recipient.<br/><br/>Bitcoin advantages:<br/><br/>1. High safety level<br/>No one can block a Bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin does not depend on central banks, local and international laws, religion and other things. Banks and the government do not control your bitcoins — they are only available to you. The wallet is created anonymously. Cryptocurrency cannot be faked, and payments cannot be cancelled.<br/><br/>2. Cheap transactions anywhere in the world<br/>Transfer fees do not depend on the amount or location. They make up less than US$1 (regardless of the amount). You can transfer money to anyone from anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>3. Convenience<br/>Unlike bank transactions, bitcoin transactions may be carried out on a 24/7 basis. You can decide independently when to transfer money.<br/><br/>4. Instant transfers<br/>Bank transfers take 3–5 working days on average. The speed of transfers via Bitcoin is a few seconds, or, when you are dealing with large amounts of money, — 10–60 minutes.<br/><br/>5. Protection against inflation<br/>National currencies depreciate annually by 1–20 % (sometimes more). Bitcoin is backed by a limited number of units (21 million) and protected against inflation. Cryptocurrency is becoming more and more popular, since people do not spend money on fees and instantly exchange money. In the future, the world national currencies will be merged in a single digital Bitcoin currency! MMM and Bitcoin have a similar vision: they strive to overthrow social inequality, free people from the banks’ oppression and make the world a more just place."

In the first week of 2017, Bitcoin dropped by over 30%.<br/><br/>Another knock on Bitcoin being a long-term store of value is that 60%–80% of the transactions on its exchanges are done by machines. Therefore, its price is largely driven by algorithms and speculators.<br/><br/>n closing, with the price of Bitcoin now higher than that of an ounce of solid gold, we will side with Jim Rickards and take the gold.

1269,2017-03-27 10:04:20.837,"Be careful.  Never buy BTU. This solution is backed by most Chinese miners, not the other nodes (exchanges, etc).  Testing of BU has been very erratic and led to some unacceptable bugs.  Also, playing with block size limits will prove to be the wrong way of dealing with scalability (Segwit has a long way of updates, but is much more future-proof).  The lead developer for BU is the very controversial Roger Ver.  His team of developers is so small, and does not share all the expertise of Core.  Roger Ver is betting on BU, betting that his many &quot;hundred of thousands&quot; of BTC converted into BTU will allow him to circumvent the will of the people who will keep believing on the original BTC and its better approach in term of scalability updates. BU can be compared to a dictatorship move, only powered by the money of very few individuals (if not only one) and their army of Chinese miners (pure muscles, no brain).  Roger Ver will just succeed to bring BTC lower for a moment, but ultimately, his prophecy will be doomed ;-)  I bet there will be a HF, and that BTC price will rise again after 2 weeks, the time for : <br/>1. BTU price to drop a lot, BTC price to drop as well but in a lower proportion than BTU.<br/>2. Chinese BTU miners to realize BTU won&#39;t be profitable for long as the people supporting BTC  will have the last word. <br/>3. BTC wil automatically lower the difficulty of mining, thus rebalance the capacity to validate transactions ( + benefits from Segwit)<br/>4. BTC price will rise again once BTU will be reduced to 5% of the market cap of BTC, not representing a threat anymore<br/>Conclusion : there is a short winter coming.. but it won&#39;t last long. <br/>I&#39;d recommend : <br/>&gt; Keep everything in Fiat currencies until the first days of HF.  Some would prefer to keep BTC.. why not, as today price has already anticipated the most likely HF coming.  <br/>&gt; Be careful with the &quot;other most famous altcoins&quot; (Ether, Dash, Monero, etc)..  A huge correction can&#39;t be ruled out, as their recent gains have nothing to do with their fundamental; They only moved up thanks to BTC uncertainties which could be lifted in the coming weeks.   <br/>&gt; I don&#39;t see any risk with less popular altcoins (GNT, REP, etc), I mean those not traded in fiat currencies, as they only represent their fundamental, not a safe heaven to edge youself against BTC.  Yet, their fundamental can be very risky.. but that&#39;s another topic."

1272,2017-03-27 04:16:53.257,"Instead of everyone humping their gums and sitting on the fence about BTC vs BU , do something about it. Both sides of the fence need nodes running. If your in the BTC camp, download and run a full node (something severely lacking in the Core world mainly due to large mining pools and online &quot;nodes&quot; . Likewise if your in the Unlimited camp download and run a full BU node.

1287,2017-03-26 07:44:00.023,...very interesting and risky times across the alts -- having cleared out of lil ETHy and lil DashY at their current price their is simply no point in playing for the stake required -- it was fun but checked out  ahead of the BTC dump which was a welcome transition point...when I look at all the Alt charts it&#39;s not a good time to be deciding to buy in imo dyor ;))-- some epic peaks in there...I have taken an experimental stake in the anti  alt XRP for fun -- heck the bankers are in on it so who knows ;))...that said my majority stake bought back in here @900 when she confirmed trend supt despite numerous attempts to dump it lower...my position on any split is that I have nothing to lose -- BTU should be listed as a new ALT and if we&#39;re holding BTC in a wallet (even our nano s&#39;) we&#39;ll get cut in...i wonder if all the punters will sell their BTC to hold BTU?? - -not me - the original has its issues but the BTU push just looks like a CHN push to own BTC for themselves -Chadler Guo in the mix AGAIN!! (same on ETH - threatened to mine against it now a huge fan!?!?!?)....I was carefully considering where to park my alt money and after much searching BTC again came out on top and thanks to the ALT surge there are a few more in the kitty...from the 6month; onger term conservative trend supt(stops) remain 910 -- fist STTarget to confirm secondary extension sees 1010 in play -- break with vol then 1110 ...best of holding/trading everyone --stay nimble/use stops -- protect capital ;)))

1344,2017-03-24 15:00:48.170,Hey @McDuff71@Mng87 @ZeroCool86 is this the beginning of the end of BTC (as we know it)  i&#39;m not talking about price points but fundamentally? I have a bad feeling with all this hard fork talk. One bad thing about Cryptonians is that we can&#39;t agree on shit look at all the fighting BEFORE the DAO hack. I don&#39;t like the way things look.  Prices are going down and there is value but I almost feel like I&#39;m getting a a cabin upgrade after the titanic has set sail

If you believe in the long term future of BTC, this and everything below, is the buy in. The price is NOT risk adjusted! If you you cannot take the current risks, 970&#39;ies is NOT the price for you. If you believe in blue skies in the future, then it is. Make your bets gentlemen. Personally, I want it cheaper, but I fully get those that are buying in now."
1348,2017-03-24 12:49:23.633,BTC/USD To Retest $1000<br/>Bitcoin price  break support $1000
1349,2017-03-24 10:20:59.620,"I think the following outcome is the most likely to occur : <br/>1. The HF between Core (BTC) and Unlimited (BTU) will be effective as no consensus would be reached. <br/>2. The situation won&#39;t be comparable to the HF between ETH and ETC as here, the allocation of hashing power will not show a clear and immediate winner.   <br/>3. The price of both coins BTC and BTU will drop as the market cap for the sum of both will remain equal (or would even drop due to the lack of visibility and fear from investors).  This drop could reach a theoretical 50% due to the +100% dilution effect (people receive BTU &quot;for free&quot;; it&#39;s like inflationary policy of a Central Bank issuing an extra 100% of the currency currently in circulation).  For ETC, it did not happen this way as ETC impact was very limited (arount 15% of the sum of ETC+ETH market cap). <br/>4. As a paradox, this situation will relieve some pressure on the Backlog of BTC (better as e-gold), which will bleed hard but would not die.  <br/>5. Simultaneously, while BTC becomes boring, and BTU too (as BTU is controversial, represents a quick fix rather than a long term solution to BTC problems), innovation comes forward with a long term fix for BTC, this time with massive consensus (as there is no more rush for quick &amp; dirty fix on a boring BTC).  This long term fix will turn BTC into both, a perfect e-gold AND e-currency (New!).  That would reduce BTU into ashes. <br/>6.  BTC regains traction, keeps its No1 network effect and stays No1.. despite the rise and rise of dark currencies, threatening the supremacy of BTC, without bringing the destructive blow, as today&#39;s real life payments remain denominated in BTC (real merchants, online payments, etc) and today BTC market cap is still roughly 20x higher than Dash, its closer rival.  Also, not all exchanges offer Dash (and other dark currencies) in their trading list, thus it would slow down their adoption (at least until BTC long term fix). <br/><br/>As investor, I&#39;d therefore advise the sell BTC before the HF to stay out of this mess, to keep a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach during the week/month after the HF, and when the first signs of a long term fix for BTC emerges, buy back BTC.  Personally, I&#39;d never buy BTU. <br/>If you keep some BTC before the HF takes place, you take the risk that your exchange is too late in listing BTU (or that it happens during the night without warning) and that you are not able to quickly sell all your BTU into fiat currencies (or at least in BTC) as I predict BTU to drop more than BTC, as it represents the choice of miners, not investors.  This is a totally subjective perception.  <br/>Thanks for your comments."

Our best outcome is if it is taxed like a Savings/Money Market accoun. BUT HOW CAN YOU ESTABLISH A FAIR TAX RATE with volatility like this. <br/>Furthermore, what if you bought it on Polo or another exchange for $1200+ &amp; sold it later on Coinbase for $1001 to cut your losses BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY EXCHANGE BTC FOR FIAT IN THE US ON COINBASE .  These guys are going to try to go after criminals who most are to smart to operate in the United States or use Coinbase, the only people that are going to get hurt are the small time speculators, people like me. <br/><br/>Coinbase reporting to the IRS on all their customers info &amp; add it with their awesome Customer Service, Transparency &amp; all around shittyness =<br/> BANKRUPTCY !!!!!!!!<br/><br/> We need a Crypto lobby YESTERDAY.  This is the time when it&#39;s good that maybe some of the hated big banks, Microsoft J.P. Morgan etc. are getting into ETH &amp; other things because if their future interests are in jeapordy umm shit they own D.C.  all the same these laws or lack of them have no way to define Bitcoin or for that matter ETHEREUM what the fuck is that? A commodity? A Currency. A smart Contract, how do you tax a smart contract?  I get that they feel they have to have some regulation but all they&#39;re going to do is push people to overseas exchanges &amp; try to put outdated banking, finance, stock laws on a borderless thing.  Here comes a wave of Zcash and privacy centric Alts. If it is regulated to keep criminals ( terrorists, sex traffickers) the real bad guys out of crypto I&#39;m all for it but you know they will fuck it up. <br/>Lastly,  I know the percentage of US bitcoin/ETH users is small but I think this is the start of a REALLY BIG DEAL. Remember Regulators,  if you regulate and tax it you also have to provide insurance like the FDIC, how about FBIC &amp; FEIC.<br/> Maybe They could allow the first 10K or less and be exempt or something. The IRS realistically doesn&#39;t have the staff or resources to do their job now &amp; they&#39;re going to be cut even more.

It seems like it&#39;s easier for BU to just blame core for attacking them, which at this time there&#39;s no evidence of such. Even if it is true, there are many people that will attack the bitcoin network. There are alt coins and criminals that want to steal your coins or hurt the bitcoin network. You want your software to not be buggy so **no one** can attack your nodes, it doesn&#39;t matter who. It is the responsibility of BU developers to make sure their code is well tested and bug free, but that does not appear to be the case.<br/><br/>BU really needs to review and scrutinize their code because it can get a lot worse like remote code execution where adversaries take control of a node completely and does whatever the adversary wants.<br/><br/>Just think if BU did take over the blockchain a month ago which is worth 16+ billion dollars and these crashes happen, how can you possibly support bitcoin? You traded a heavy and more expensive bucket for a bucket with holes to carry water. People will move to alt coins. These ASIC miners will become unfeasible to operate and even unusable for mining other popular alt coins.&quot;"
1387,2017-03-22 01:04:15.863,"People ask about the fork and which one to choose , my opinion is : People will choose BU of course , it will be faster more reliable etc etc. I think the mistake is in forcing people to choose , because that will let some of the miners and buyers make a mistake unwillingly. I think thats what the speculators want. If a system is old and must be renewed , so why the old system still stays ? Give everyone new coins from the new currency and nobody lose.

Bitcoin is just going through a bit of internal issues and can&#39;t decide whether to adopt bitcoin unlimited or segwit in order to scale up with growth.  I hope those involved can come to unity and not hold each other hostage. Bitcoin prices will drop like what we&#39;re seeing now and everyone will lose confidence.  We share the same goal and all want digital currency as the future and Bitcoin needs to succeed.   These prices are amazing to me, but I&#39;m all out of cash.

To cut to the chase -- The Chinese mining problem (i&#39;m clumping a bunch of arguments together - Mining concentration, 51% attacks, Chinese internet manipulation, blah blah blah) are some serious weaknesses in Bitcoin. I have no problem with a &quot;chinese&quot; centric maket any more then I have with US, EUR, UK, or any other majority controlled market.

This decision comes after careful consideration of our revenue and operating costs in Washington. While revenue continues to grow, operating costs have become prohibitive, primarily due to the high cost of continuing to meet the regulatory compliance requirements imposed by the state.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it has become impractical for us to operate in Washington and we must discontinue service for all residents. Since you are a Washington resident, we are sorry that we must suspend all services in your account. Services will be turned off in two steps according to the schedule below:<br/><br/>    Wednesday March 15th: Deposits and trading will be suspended for all Washington residents - please stop all trading before this date<br/>    Wednesday March 22nd: Withdrawals will be suspended for all Washington residents - please withdraw all accounts funds before this date <br/><br/>After withdrawals are suspended it will still be possible to get your funds, but you will need to contact support for special instructions and processing will likely take much longer than normal. If you have any trouble withdrawing your funds, please submit a support request to: https://support.kraken.com/hc/requests/new<br/><br/>Use the subject/category “WA Resident” to help ensure a quick response.<br/><br/>MtGox Creditors<br/><br/>If you have filed a MtGox creditor claim through Kraken, don’t worry.

Based on the SEC’s past decisions and attitude towards innovative ETFs, it is difficult to favor the Winklevoss twins for the approval of their COIN ETF. However, the involvement of a well-respected $30 bln financial institution and the participation of analysts independent of the SEC and the Winklevoss twins, such as quant traders from KCG and Susquehanna, gives hope."

1629,2017-03-05 01:03:20.037,"58% of BTC is now JPY, more than every other currency put together. Will the big story in 2017 be how BTC  went mainstream in Japan? Once the Japanese actually start paying their electric bills in BTC then the Japanese electric companies will be stockpiling BTC (an interesting thought). But the real draw for the consumer is that BTC is deflationary, if a Japanese household bought themselves say $5000 worth of BTC in order to pay their electric bills for the next four or five years then the saving they would make over time would be well worth the effort if BTC continues to increase in value. Over time they would be using a smaller and smaller amounts of BTC to pay the same monthly bill. Its a very attractive prospect.<br/><br/>If this caught on then this could prove to be key in moving BTC from an asset into an actual mainstream currency. After all the Utility companies would start to spend it as well, or use it to finance their own mining activities perhaps?<br/><br/>If Japanese households start buying BTC  in large volume to pay future bills then the effect would be to increase the scarcity pressure on the price of BTC as they would be buying bitcoin and spending it and buying more bitcoin, which is very different from buying it and sitting on it or just doing chinese style washtrading.<br/><br/>Is this an incredibly shrewd move by Shinzo Abe? Power and water have to be paid month in month out, they are not like washing machines or cars or whatever where you just wait if you think the price will drop. Utility bills are timebound so if you pay them with bitcoin then you are going to be buying your bitcoin up front or even in bulk and paying it out over a period of time, using progressively smaller proportions of your BTC stash to pay your utility bills over time. <br/><br/>It seems that there might be far more to the use of BTC to pay utilities bills than meets the eye :)"

If that gets triggered, I will be fully out and waiting for buying opportunity.<br/><br/>The SEC Hype has driven this thing to be heavily underweight.  Just months ago I was predicting 1100 by end of March.  The annual band secular trend still reads 1100 by end of March, and the longer term secular trend is under 1000.  This thing is way underweight.<br/><br/>Sure, if the SEC approves, there will be a surge, but I&#39;ll be happy with my 25% in there, and I have the trailing stop limit for security, because while the surge could be huge (I&#39;m talking $2000+), I expect it will be short lived (less than 2 weeks before it comes back to earth, $1000 range).<br/><br/>On the flipside, if the SEC disapproves, this thing will not only correct, it will over shoot.  A correction right now puts us at around $1000.  <br/><br/>Sure, I&#39;ve got some FOMO for only having 50% since 1090, but seriously, I&#39;m actually happy with a the return.<br/><br/>I am glad to not be all-in on this one.

He notes that this is a positive development which reveals that Bitcoin is becoming more legitimate and welcome into the mainstream. Good news.

Do you really believe the world is going mad over bitcoin or the SEC decision to regulate it as an ETF or over crypton currency generally, further more... REALLY do you think that bitcoin can replace the dollar and decentralise the banks, well hate to burst your bubble but bitcoin cannot do that, however block chain technology can. The million dollar question is what is backing bitcoin that the banks cant recreate themselves and ask yourselves exactly what have you invested in bitcoin or block chain because it seems to me that new technologies are going to surpass bitcoin in the very near future that’s if it hasn’t already happened ...  remember mass hysteria + confusion + emotions + unethical behaviour = set up = ponzi scheme?

1706,2017-02-24 04:16:58.900,"@Mng87 makes good points but an ETF is not really that huge of a deal if you really think about it. I guess there is the fact that most Firms/Funds in money market accounts allow people to get into ETFs for substantially less than the $2500 or $5000+minimum that most Mutual Funds require so they can buy very small amounts  but you can do that with bitcoin already I think Coinbase allows you to buy just $10 worth or something. There is the &quot;perceived&quot; acceptance  and mainstream coming out of the shadows whole aspect to it and I am all for the price going up. <br/>@larrysmith1000  as a excellent strategy which I am somewhat following of holding half and sewing have I&#39;m basically doing that but in thirds although,  if he continues to climb like this song rumors what is it going to do if it actually is approved??? <br/>This whole ETF thing reminds me of playing craps/Dice and continuing to press with a hot shooter,  you know eventually they&#39;re going to seven out, but if you bring down your bets and they make 3-4 more points you&#39;re kicking yourself but if you keep pressing and they seven out on the next role you&#39;re kicking yourself for that as well. <br/>If it continues to get too much higher I may have to sell a few more and go with the 50-50 @Larrysmith1000 approach better to be safe than sorry.<br/> This is all good for crypto currency"

1709,2017-02-24 03:06:10.183,"So my personal take on this...<br/><br/>*** Do remember, I could be wrong in the extreme. Make up your own mind about this!***<br/><br/>new information hit the market, that Winklevoss twins etc al, plus big guns in SEC and Bats had a meeting on the 14th. Minutes are not published, but an amendment with minor corrections was submitted on the 22nd. Memorandum of the meeting was published on the 23rd. Meeting with SolidX with fewer big guns held on the 22nd (?).<br/><br/>Reddit went nuts interpreting this as almost approval. Unfortunately none of these people seem to understand how regulation works, and what due diligence before a decision looks like. To me, NOTHING can be interpreted about the outcome from this, other than the SEC being EXTREMELY aware, that whatever will be decided can have serious ramifications, and that this is a highly unorthodox and controversial asset class.<br/><br/>The dynamic is thus. There are two people left on SEC. They vote on approval or disapproval. Chairman has tie-breaker. We know that the  other member is positive about Bitcoin. Yet that does NOT prove, that she is positive about the ETF proposals at hand, even if she IS in favour of some kind of ETF. The chairman is essentially the decider. He is going to be replaced soon by Trump appointees.<br/><br/>This means, that the ETF will be one of the last things he does. He will be remembered for it, regardless of what is decided and how it pans out. Giving unprecidented transparacy = covering your ass! If anything goes wrong (either from approval or disapproval), he wants to be able to say, I did my job. Everyone could follow the proceedings. There was no major dissent to the process. I was justified in my choice. Does this mean approval? No. Does this mean rejection? No.<br/><br/>It means chairman does not want to be the fall guy!<br/><br/>Talk about price reacting close to the 14th is bullsh!t. At this point in time, no decision has been made, and not even the Winklevoss twins know what the outcome will be. If they did, that would be insider trading, regardless of what they did (sell, buy, hold). The decision isn&#39;t in.<br/><br/>All this means is that the Chairman of the current SEC KNOWS that this could heavily impact his name and legacy. Due diligence and transparency is the way to mitigate the effects of potentially making the wrong call.<br/><br/>Signalling the decision, or it&#39;s bias, BEFORE announcement, so you can buy or sell BTC, before the ETF happens or not, is NOT something the SEC would do. It is insider trading. I can&#39;t believe the SEC would allow that to happen. I don&#39;t understand how those that are buying based on this news don&#39;t realize that if they interpreted this correctly, they are acting on SEC generated insider trading knowledge.<br/><br/>But they don&#39;t seem to care. Reddit Markets has gone into moon kid mode. Remember how near-sighted the community is, and how they overreact to news, and frequently interpret it entirely wrong. Just two weeks ago, we were close to meltdown, because China ban bitcoin, and a Chinese firesale would destroy Bitcoin and bring us into at least one year of Bear market. None of this ETF stuff was important just TWO WEEKS AGO!!"

What do you guys make of this surge is it just people who are not crypto junkies like us &amp; see tidbits here and there about the ETF and just jumping in especially after the mainstream press coverage about how Bitcoin was 2016&#39;s BEST investment in EVERY financial sector/product/stock etc. and not wanting to miss the boat?  From a personal standpoint I hope that the CTF is actually denied so that I can go back in gobble up a few more at a reduced rate because there will be an inevitable selloff I don&#39;t think it will go back to $500 but If I could get a few more at $7 - $800  and then suck him away and subzero storage for the long long game

1722,2017-02-22 06:28:20.617,"This has been my considerations of the market over the last 24 hours. <br/><br/>*****<br/>I do NOT offer this as trading advice! Make up your own mind, and trade accordingly! I am not a professional trader, and you don&#39;t want my loss/win ratio! I write this to organize my thoughts, understand the market better, and collect inputs and feedback.<br/>*****<br/><br/>As we all can see, prices are swinging wildly at the moment. A couple of hours before normal business hours for SEC, we saw a huge surge in price action, that sent us parabolic. Right at the time, of the first possible chance of announcement of the COIN application, selling and buying entered a grind stage, at least on BitStamp. Buy and sell orders of all possible sizes flooded the completed trades. They executed so fast I could not even read them. Sellers were so aggressive they drove prices down.... on a parabolic drive up - this is not the same crowd (or rather sentiment) of sellers we saw on the drive up to 1071  a few days ago!!<br/><br/>As it became clear that no announcement came in the early US business hours, pressure began to subside, and prices went slightly up. But it was shortlived as they have dropped overnight, with quite a few dips to partake in. Clearly, this was positioning in FOMO for the SEC, and disappointment in no announcement, and then experienced hands shaking out the weak in the marketplace. The swings are large, so it is hard to have effective stops for a position. Which IMHO makes this a dangerous marketplace. We have possibly 13 business days to go, and being stopped out repeatedly by experienced traders that use the fear, greed and fomo of the weak to take their coins and money will proceed until we have clarity. It is clear that stop hunters have been at work during the night, and have been quite successful!<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons why I vowed to myself, that I would not hold position in the US business hours while we could get a COIN announcement - and only do quick smash and grabs on all other hours. The other reason is the odds and stakes of this ETF. There are several estimates at chances of success and what is at stake. If we look at the Needham report, chances are less than 25%. Generally  accepted ranges for price upon approval are 2-3k to 6xx upon rejection. Beyond explaining what this means for long term trends, let&#39;s look at those kinds of propositions. Personally I have signed up for getting the BATS rule making announcements sent to me directly upon publication. But even then, getting it within SECONDS of publication, I doubt I can understand it before the market reacts. And the market might initially react the wrong way, adding hazard to the situation. You can get stopped out, even IF you got it right!<br/><br/>With stop hunters at work, wild swings at low vol, and the potential for the market making the wrong initial reaction, using stops effectively is very tricky. Holding a position to the 11th with tight stops seems unviable. Holding a position with wide stops to the 11th presents large risks for losses. Believing that it will be an easy ride up or down if you have the right position is unrealistic. Study the past flash crashes, and you will see that even successful hardened bitcoin traders got it wrong repeatedly during the last crash.<br/><br/>With 75% chance of rejection (which I think is being generous, very few outside of Bitcoin even believe that it is this generous), you have a 75% chance of going from 11xx to 6xx in a flash crash. Conversely, you can go to 1400-1500 in a buying stampede that is also very, very short in time span (25% chance) with more to come in the next weeks. Also, we do have traders on the exchanges, that are not here for Bitcoin, but just for profit. Currently, despite the dangers of doing so, there ARE leveraged shorts and longs in the market (shorts dropping and longs rising). So reversals during a rise/drop are bound to happen as stops are triggered and profits taken, leaving the potential for being faked or stopped out, even with favourable price movement for the given position. This action, spurred by announcement, can happen at any moment, even when you are mid trade on another position, and have not set proper stops yet. Volume is low, tensions are high, and thus range is high with potential for many false starts.<br/><br/>I see more and more wildly unrealistic claims by the community on specialized news sites and on reddit. Articles are being lambasted for reporting outcome of the probability generator on BitMex, despite the results being generally far more positive than any credible report we have seen, and way more positive, than even the sentiment of the lawyer that drafted amends for the Winklevoss Twins amendments to SEC. Besides those positions that created those results are coming from the community of traders themselves, but they CANNOT accept those odds! Clearly, as a whole, the community is out of touch with reality.<br/><br/>There are many people that are asking for advice on setting large leverages, how leverages work on various sites, and how to set up yolo trades specifically geared on the SEC decision to make one shot millionaires. This IMHO adds even more instability to the market, and I don&#39;t consider this trading at all. Those kinds of positions are high stakes gambling = idiocy. The current odds are close enough to gambling as it is, there is no reason to make it worse!<br/><br/>To add to the problem, with the last surge, we have officially entered long pole territory, which means we are in the zone where flash corrections can happen just because the market is overheated. Looking at the price range over the last couple of years, it is very suggestive that Bitcoin is about to enter a new trend. Patterns mentioned are 3 year cup and handle, but also double and triple top. To be fair not all patterns pan out even if they complete, but this sets us up right for the trademark mentality of the bitcoin trader community, moon or doom. ATH legend and fear of past fractals is not improving the situation. There is no middle way of the road, and oddly enough, this mentality  is self-fullfilling on so many levels.<br/><br/>One could take a word of caution from the top trader futures sentiment, that they have been full bearish at almost all times since friday, reaching 57% at times for short positions. Sentiment has fluctuated wildly in since Friday, but at no point, except just now as I write this, has it switched to long. The top futures traders have gone bear, even though they were bull all week after the drop on the 10th. Short leverage is used a lot more than long. Personally, I think they are fluctuating because they are exiting position from the post crash retracement and building a new one. They are hedging - as they SHOULD! In general, you don&#39;t trade on a news day, before news has broken. Well given the situation, and they trade futures, they have no choice. Hedging is the only smart solution.<br/><br/>My guess: Shorts for the SEC which is the dominant position, and then long for this week on the weeklies, because they don&#39;t know when the decision comes and they have to take the current price level into account. If this is true, then they DO NOT expect a decision this week, but DO expect price decline on the quarterlies (despite promised lifting of withdrawal ban on Chinese exchanges being bound create a surge) and positive price development this week. No one has seemed to really noticed this, or if they have, don&#39;t talk about it. But a change in sentiment, closing of old positions and unfolding of a new trading strategy amongst what is probably not lone traders, but institutional traders, or maybe even a group of highly skilled professionals, is significant.<br/><br/>What worries me, for bitcoin, is that community sentiment and trading strategies are getting out of touch with reality, and entering what I can only see as an old and familiar territory: &quot;This time it will be different!&quot; It might, but chances are low, unless you believe that fundamentals with a SEC rejection can carry price into a new positive segment of price range on log scale. Personally, I doubt this and I don&#39;t believe in the approval. What worries me for the community traders is the high level of emotion being displayed. Fear of missing out, greed, fear of loss, fear of having made mistakes and abandonment of trading strategies, that are made with reason based on sensible risk and hedging. Trading on emotion is dangerous. This trading environment is equally dangerous, as it swings in large range quickly, is in precarious territory and has dangerous positions, dynamics and sentiments built into it.<br/><br/>You could argue, that this is temporary and will sort outself out in a few weeks. Well, in Bitcoin world a few weeks is ages. And once the COIN situation is sorted, we have SolidX coming up at the END of March, leading to what I see as a repeat of what is going on now.<br/><br/>In short, I find the current situation hostile to proper and well executed trading. That is why I am out of position, and staying out of position. WIth the Euro/USD pair showing improvement for USD, my current best move seems to be to withdraw all fiat from BitStamp and send it home in Euros. A surprising conclusion, but this is my outlook. You can argue, that I stand to miss out on a historical win. That might be right, but I don&#39;t think I do. I think that is out of touch with reality. How many of those people that claim ETF will bring comet like price surges long term actually understand what an ETF is, and under which circumstances they would pruchase BTC or hand it back to the market? How many leaders of businesses do we know of that think more of BitCoin than they do of blockchain technology? What if the demand for ETF shares just isn&#39;t there at the levels the community expects?<br/><br/>Or to say it in a different way, here is a different take on what the ETF means, has meant and WILL mean in the future.<br/><br/>http://woobull.com/estimates-on-the-price-impact-and-capital-inflows-of-a-bitcoin-etf/"

Presumably we&#39;d be claiming that Chinese and other traders are speculating on the SEC decision. Does anyone have evidence of that speculation, other than their own sentiment? I haven&#39;t been speculating on the SEC decision, but on the general success of bitcoin. Most people here probably expect to stay into bitcoin. So why are we assuming that other people&#39;s speculation is short term? That the price dip will be as low as 800 after the approval deadline? I think that&#39;s exaggerated. And if it were to drop, I&#39;d expect it to recover within days, not months."

My thinking is that if the ETF is approved there will be enough time with the money in my Coinbase USD account to get a few back in time B4 this apparent surge &amp; vise versa as I can pick some up some on the cheap with the $ in Coinbase hands already.<br/>I&#39;m still not convinced that the proce will skyrocket or triple to 3K if its approved or plummet to $500 if denied as @ Mng87 said people are already holding/buying as if it may be approved. I think a lot of people are doing this like with stocks. &#39;Its already baked into the cake&#39; earnings reports or whatever.<br/>Personally I sold a 3rd of mine &amp; if it were to drop to $500 I could gobble up a bunch more to put in Sub Zero Storage. <br/>I wouldent call it hedging but there is some truth to the notion that &quot;Any Press is Good Press&quot; no matter what happens with the ETF there will be coverage &amp; it may attract more people to it if denied, &amp; at a lower price for a short while. Eventually, BTC will have an ETF, MF, &amp; other Financial products will embrace it. Maybe not this time, but in time.

I&#39;m actually hoping more for a price decline so it looks more appealing to others(and myself who would just like more.)

I assume that this forum &amp; others use what I call &quot;stock market volume.&quot; or averages of many exchanges to measure volume. But with BTC are they weighted in what we consider the traditional &quot;stock market volume&quot; as I have asked before I struggle to even define what Bitcoin is. A Commodity/Currency ?  My point is as a Lehman and not a market and was like many of you here my basic understanding of real volume and price is based upon what Is ingrained and me from how the traditional New York Stock Exchange works with volume, traditional indexes whatever you want to call it. <br/> My question(s) is I guess that BTC doesn&#39;t seem to follow the long established volume trend lines of your traditional commodity or whatever it is. My financial education is only at the low end of undergrad spectrum. But can someone smarter than me explain why volume trend lines dont seem to match up like your traditional stock/commodity with price volatility.  I get that investment firms are not buying in large blocks and there are whales and all types of larger investors and it&#39;s a different market but  does anyone know really why? It appears that volume is being manipulated obviously even with regulation and maybe it&#39;s an argument for regulation I don&#39;t know."

However, most countries are signatory to Interpol and other law enforcement agencies and can extradite alleged criminals. <br/>Where stolen bitcoins go, I have no idea, however, it is fair to assume they will try to either exchange and/or buy things so as to convert back to fiat. Some people / organizations may discount the value of the bitcoins to convert it back to fiat. <br/>I am not privy to any secret financial authority that monitors hacked activity, however, all bitcoins brought/sold in the United States are tracked (as required by law) by all the legal exchanges and/or companies dealing in bitcoin. What inferences they (the law enforcement authorities) can get out of it, is anyone’s guess. <br/>One would ideally never hack from the same country one is in, it is just way to easier to get in trouble with the local laws.<br/><br/>given his opinion, could someone say or prove him otherwise? why would only third world countries have lax security laws but not the u.s. or canada????????? rsvp"

1793,2017-02-09 19:36:37.970,"It could be a good sign for Bitcoin (in the long run) that the Chinese Government wants to put standard regulations in place. Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules have become standard procedures in major bitcoin markets, including the U.S.. And did that put harm to BTC? No, it is exactly the opposite! It only caused short-term glitches - great chances for buying.<br/><br/>BTCC has put those procedures in place already long time ago. As a result they are the only big Chinese exchange that didn&#39;t have to stop withdrawls like the others. <br/><br/>And there is an additional argument: China aims to become a big player in Blockchain research and development. They know how important this technology may become in the future. Without a strong currency backing a distributed blockchain ledger there will be no strong blockchain security. Thus in my opinion it is pretty unlikely China has any interest in really harming Bitcoin.<br/><br/>In the end this regulation might be an important step for Bitcoin to become more widely accepted and less volatile - resulting in much more growth in value.

1809,2017-02-09 11:04:08.873,"So, from the point of view on Bitstamp, the last pullback was not due to sell pressure, it was due to lack of interest. The path to a new high was clear, there just wasn&#39;t any takers. It is not so clear now. On the other hand, a sub channel within the channel that has supported us since the crash, has formed, and that provided support at the low at yesterday&#39;s meltdown.<br/><br/>The line can be drawn from the low on the 5th and the 8th, and it runs parallel to the main channel - so if the main channel is divided into quarters, where we are challenging the center trend line, we are bouncing around in the second lowest quarter. To underscore this, a 162 coin bid has recently been put into 1040 acting as support exactly on this line. A single 110 Coin purchase stabilized the latest rebound from topping out and going into a deeper pullback. The old 500 Coin bid @ 1025 acts as support from dropping completely out of channel and is currently at 762 - and since we know the futures game is important to the development of the spot price, these details matter!<br/><br/>It seems we are at a stand off. This large bid at the price of 1025 is sufficient to let us stay in channel until the OKCoin futures expire tomorrow at 9am (where we start a new week and a whole new game) - unless we see a 2000+ coin meltdown. Given that the bull seems to be suffering from exhaustion, but on the other hand reasonable supports bids have been put in place at the most immediate levels of support, I think that a drop out of channel is not to be expected in the next 24 hours. A challenge for a new high (beyond 1082) is also not to be expected, because the interest is clearly not there, and a single purchase on BitStamp for 110 coins stabilized the whole situation and put us into level trade - up though IS the path of least resistance.<br/><br/>Sideways we go for now, unless some major player decides to buy or drop coins in a pretty decent volume. And since the OKCoin futures expire in less than 24 hours, this could actually happen! But my guess is that strength is being conserved for next week."

1820,2017-02-08 02:53:35.477,"Will people be able to adapt to a price deflationary currency?  True, Bitcoin is technically monetarily inflationary, but if things go as planned, it will take decades (possibly a couple centuries) to replace global fiat currencies.  So here are a few economic thought experiments: <br/><br/>- Remuneration. Imagine the employer employee relationship.  With price deflation, an employee will need to expect that the employer will cut their pay over time.  A good employee would simply have his or her pay cut less.  How will this pan out psychologically for the employee?  In terms of productivity, it&#39;s a great thing if employees can adjust.  Get as much produced as soon as possible before the price of the product you are producing drops!<br/><br/>- Lending.  On the one hand interest rates will rise, because money will have more value over time (the definition price deflation), so lenders will be less willing to lend.  However, the borrowers will not benefit from inflation as they do today.  It will take quite an adjustment in mindset for a borrower realize the cost of their nominally fixed mortgage payments will increase over time.  While at the same time their home (or other asset) depreciates.  Perhaps BTC loan amortization schedules will have descending payment amounts.  Even better, savers will buy their homes with cash!<br/><br/> - Commodities and Goods. commodities will depreciate (including the mother GOLD, when the change in supply of BTC is less than the rate of change in supply of GOLD).  This could be very good.  If a commodity or good depreciates, then there is a large incentive to transport it, use it to build something, and sell it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>This all leads to the hording of currency.  Most economists would freakout at this, but think about it.  Shouldn&#39;t money be valuable?  Isn&#39;t saving good?  On the one hand, spending and lending is discouraged, and on the other speed of production is encouraged (because the cost of good and services will go up tomorrow, so make it and sell it today!)  <br/><br/>There is a price point for everything, but in a deflationary market things start to look much different than what people are used to today.  <br/><br/>Psychologically, will 1 or 2 generations be able to make the adjustment?"

1825,2017-02-07 10:23:57.223,"So I have been watching this spike all the way through the build up to 1040+ on BitStamp. As far as I understand it, increase in price presupposes increase in demand. Thus the utility of using OBV as an indicator. Higher price means more people are willing to buy. Yet as far as I can see on the OBV, it is way lower than it was when we reached 1000. It took boatloads of volume to get to 1000 and after that the going got tougher, with the first spike towards 1040 being 1500 in volume and getting absolutely nowhere and ending in the tanking of the price.<br/><br/>Now this is the part that I don&#39;t really get. At the top of the downwards sliding channel, no one wanted to buy. Until someone put in a 500BTC bid at 1025. This bid never took any coins, nor did it move at all after the price started to rise. Positions just kept overbidding those 500BTC. It is still there as I am typing this.<br/><br/>All the way up, the tip of the bid pool was paper thin and only got trickle buys. The ask queue was just very small amounts of BTC. The slippage was massive, with 1-2 coins moving the price up to several USD. Yet at the stages where the price rise stopped, there is massive selling action. If you look at the 1 minute trace you can see almost no one is buying, but lots of people are selling. The OBV is getting absolutely murdered. If I look at the 5 minute band, the OBV is at the level we had at the 915-920 range. Even on the 2 hour range, the current OBV is at the 940 range. <br/><br/>At first I thought I might have missed some large piece of news, like the approval of the Winklevoss ETF, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything new.<br/><br/>This doesn&#39;t seem to make sense.

1868,2017-01-29 23:46:15.827,"This might sound paranoid, but the more I see, the more I am convinced that the whole BOOM/BUST thing has been a scam. A scam using loans and futures to pump the market, and increase capital, Then use that to buy shorts, leverage and crash the market. I have seen more than one person comment on the fact that the BTC futures have looked like BTC was on the brink of death. Just imagine the profits you could run on such a move. Now add to that, if you look at all but the initial crash, those sudden fire sales are counter intuitive to technicals and indicators. Like if you wanted to grab people while they wanted to pour money into the system and create maximum panic, you&#39;d sell at the times it happened.<br/><br/>Today, we have seen a run on BitFinex and BitStamp. Not with huge capital as such, but rather with very small sales, that hammered the price, right at the moment when it looked to correct. Seriously go in and look at BitStamp 15 and 30 minute MACD. Every time it look like it would correct, just enough was sold to hammer it down. What self respecting trader would do that? What trader would program a bot to do that? You KNOW that in just 10 minutes you are going to get a better price? And why only hit BitFinex, that only major USD exchange that still offers financial instruments, and Bitstamp that traditionally is the second largest USD market? And the growth of other USD markets in volume, that also dropped as they GREW in volume?<br/><br/>All day, bid orders in USD actually grew and the number of coins for sale dropped, yet prices dropped and dropped. To me, this tells a story of people that ran a racket, got busted by the PBOC, are on the squeeze on massive dues in shorts, and are now desperate to crash the price yet again. Literally, what I have seen today on BitStamp makes no sense. Price goes up, immediately hit with 0,0001 BTC sale at shit price. OBV only affected by the occasional massive dump of someone that panics and drops 40-150 coins. But those coins affect price just as much, or as little as those small targetted attacks of 0,0x BTC.<br/><br/>To me this stinks. Someone is trying, as has been trying to short the market since the first day of the crash... to get out of massive positions in shorts. What before the PBOC looked like a sweet business strategy has now become a game of desperation on the USD exchanges."

And if so, does that mean we are actually seeing things that indicate the heading cryptocurrency is on may not be so bright?  <br/><br/>1. I am hearing people praising the Chinese Government regulation of cryptocurrency markets.  And, while the regulation is providing a benefit at the moment, don&#39;t we want the &quot;invisible hand&quot; to find a solution for crappy bot activity?  Isn&#39;t government regulation of how the currency can be traded and exchanged a slippery slope (not that we can do much about it)?  What if China outlaws sending any cryptocurrency to a foreign exchange?  What if they mandate one address per person?  Clearly they can&#39;t easily enforce these things, but they could start deterring people by putting them in jail.  Won&#39;t this hurt Crypto?<br/><br/>2. I&#39;m hearing very protectionist and nationalist views being propagated.  Do we need to remind ourselves of our original values?  Just 6 months ago the same people were going on and on about the vision of a globalized decentralized cryptocurrency that breaks down many barriers in international trade.  If we want Cryptocurrency to one day be the currency that balances international trade, don&#39;t complex protectionist policies, unilateral tariffs, and trade regulations on how cryptocurrency may be traded threaten its potential as an easy medium of international exchange?<br/><br/>To put it in perspective, are we really praising government regulation for stabilizing the market?  Haven&#39;t we seen that slippery slope before?<br/><br/>I&#39;m an eternal optimist, but I&#39;m playing the pessimist role here because I want to hear peoples ideas.

The daily volume is very low. Doesn&#39;t this look like traders buying back in small chunks to cover short positions taken on the crash? It ties in very well with the MACD on the 1 day indicates that a lower price is unlikely in the very short term. Add in bots acting on a rising price, and a couple of small scale daytraders seeing openings for a quick profit, and you could get what we see. There are no real news events  that could justify a real jump in price.

Taking into account the current global political, &amp; financial climate with (good or bad no judgement here) Trump, &amp; The rise in populism in Europe and elsewhere w/Brexit etc. <br/> This is what got me into this crypto space (&amp; out of the stock market) in the first place and reminds me of the stories I heard growing up from my Father, Uncles and Grandfather.  So please indulge me if you will as I believe that there are some of the brightest minds around on this forum, &amp; I have a very serious ?<br/>So If BTC does Explode in value ( i&#39;m not referring to slow steady growth but hyper explosion) is that what we as a collective human race should be hoping for. If it happens,  It will most likely mean that the world economy has essentially collapsed, the US dollar drowned by Chinese debt &amp; many other factors eventually defaults, and we are in a &quot;WORLDWIDE&quot; depression where ALL FIAT currency is worthless. Essentially millions or even billions of people will be starving, dying, &amp; suffering causing violent chaos, &amp; anarchy worldwide.  <br/>{SomeContext}<br/> My Eldest Uncle was constantly harping about this at nausium until the day he died (in a different context &amp; time) but for most of the same reasons that I think parrerell BTC &amp; Gold. He illegally &amp; proudly horded gold after FDR took the US off the GS in 1933, &amp; late in life after Nixon&#39;s 1971 move to COMPLETELY detach the $ from any gold &amp; the subsequent 1974 law allowing  People to once again &quot;legally&quot; buy &amp; own gold again in the US. He bought as much as he could, along with my Father, they were getting One troy ounce of gold for around $40 as the family story goes &amp; just 6 years later Gold was worth $850. <br/>  Unfortunately because of some private family issues none of that gold is left. BUT my whole point &amp; question is as we see BTC and crypto currency&#39;s becoming a lot like gold but with a very fixed supply.  I&#39;m not certain we have to have a global crisis for BTC to reach those type of levels Just a lot of chaos &amp; uncertainty.<br/>Lastly, I think if we do have a true &amp; real catastrophic global financial meltdown of the magnitude of the 1930&#39;s &amp; the fiat US $ becomes as worthless as say Zimbabwe Currency (Around 200,000 Zimbabwe =$1) BTC &amp; all viable Crypto will be worth ungodly unimaginable amounts Millions/Billions Per.  My concern is that even in so-called &quot;strong&quot; democracies will they come after our BTC &amp; enact laws to make it illegal to own it like the United States did with Gold from 1933-1974.  Just Imagine what they would do in non-democratic societies to come and get your Crypto???"

This has not been talked about, but I beleive they will also search for money hidden in BTC by corrupt government officials... as usually they hide cash in their homes - but BTC would be better to hide stolen government funds...<br/><br/>They will be investigating both Bitcoin and Litecoin... they do not seem worried or interested in any other crypto.<br/><br/>so i am actually eagerly awaiting this investigation and its outcome - I think that the chinese government might actually help BTC and make BTC more stable in the long run. ...

2016,2017-01-05 19:34:54.890,Good morning campers - well woke up to find that I had been completely stopped out @1040 - I think for all of us watching the Chinese Govts manipulation of the Forex/HIBOR jacking it to 45% earler in the day was a warning shot - thats when we saw our earlier run down to hit old trend supt (mid) of 1080 and then bounce upwards. We also had mexico pull the same deal too which is clearly reflected in the BTC movements.<br/><br/>I had a buy in set @925(pre tracking supt) so am in again. Looking at the charts we see the following:<br/><br/>2 week chart has two main levels to confirm trend support - 1015 lower and 1040 midline - if we hit these and continue with vol this should break upwards.If this breaks then we turn to the 3 month for next trend line which clearly has 850.<br/><br/>For this run I am setting my stops at 915.<br/><br/>Overall I am still very bullish on this one and we need to remember that every-time that a government pulls a stunt like this all this does to those shorting FX is to confirm weakness - this game does not play out (too expensive) in the long run and makes a mockery of these seeking to confirm their currency as a genuine reserve ;))). Now that we have broken 1k and everyone is comfortable with this value we will move back across it soon enough (imo).<br/><br/>Remember stops if trading!! -very best of trading/holding everyone ;))).

I checked yesterday when things were going great there was still 3 days waiting time on one purchase &amp; 2 days waiting time on the other the money had already come out of my bank account for both buys which is fine &amp; normal.<br/>BUT at 6:16 AM my time this morning when BTC dipped below $900 on Coinbase they released both buys early???<br/> Its not the first time I&#39;ve ever gotten it early but I can say that there have been other times when the &quot;arrives today&quot; status will go on for 36-48 hours.<br/>  My obvious question is are they manipulating when they release the coins and if so can they be trusted?

He was saying that Trump&#39;s main treasury appointment is a bitcoin believer, what will this mean I wonder?<br/><br/>But never mind all that! Are we going to see gold parity this very night??????"

Merry New year.<br/> Has anyone ever noticed that no matter what the price of BTC is your Genesis Mining Contract Payout is pretty much the same. I got $2.96 worth of BTC yesterday w/BTC was going for $960-ish &amp; wouldn&#39;t you know it I went back &amp; looked that three months ago when the price was around $600-$700 I was getting the exact same amount roughly I&#39;m convinced that this is the slightest p.m. but that they manipulate the payouts in every way so that you never seem to get back more then you&#39;re contract price. This has been basically proven in the fact that BTC has doubled since I bought my Genesis contract yet my payouts remain Basically the same in US $ even though the hash rate has not gone up that much like it has W/ETH???<br/>VERY CURIOUS?????

Or even an investment account, or 401(k) etc.<br/> Four instance my August 1 Dish Network bill was almost $240 (Boxing PPV unusually high) I used BTC &amp; paid .45-.47 or something in that range, but I remember it being almost half of 1 FULL BTC at that time.

Trend on the 2 week has 950 as mid-line with 975 still needing to be broken hard in order to confirm direction towards 1k. Upper bol limit (13&#39;s) have 980 currently with chart sitting pretty much mid-line which suggests consol not overbought on the daily - 2nd early trend if extended would have had us breach 1k on the 26th - not to be yet - but slowly this wave is catching up...so 975 is still key break level heading up - break then 990/1k move  on the charts; if break to the downside then first supt level to hold is 950; if this breaks then 930 - if 900&#39;s break then mid term trend on the 3month is 825...my stops are set at 950 going into today - best of trading/holding everyone - poss 1k breach/touch today, we shall see ;))))"

2125,2016-12-28 07:16:06.457,...@mike_blue7 - the vol on the daily is just  a beautiful thing - very consistent 3-400BTC chunks every 15mins - stops now@935 ;)))
2126,2016-12-28 04:27:14.283,"...for those who have an interest, if she rolls back on the 2weekly then support levels to watch will be firstly 900-910; then 860 - break 860 then longer term support comes back into play now sitting@ 805(6 month trend) - I have my stops for this run set at 925 but will slip them upwards should we break 950 (if broken then upper range 975 should be achievable)- looking very bullish everyone, good trading/holding to all ;)))"
2127,2016-12-27 21:53:30.140,...there we go - botttom channel hit- see if she has legs to hit 950 ;)) ...gltah
2128,2016-12-27 14:39:42.850,@zerocool86 @McDuff what are you guys thinking &#128200; I&#39;m assuming there are a lot of people who could not buy BTC while banks were closed ? But that doesn&#39;t affect china or India buyers. Where do you guys go or how do you determine where volume is being generated by country or region? is there a website or something where you can see that in real time or close to real time? How are the charts looking @McDuff71
2129,2016-12-27 14:25:23.567,15B market cap at $935.00!!! this is insane!

2131,2016-12-27 12:11:22.980,Now it&#39;s going up up and away! Currently at $920!!! Whoaa!
2132,2016-12-27 04:04:05.360,"Hey guys I was planning to start a Bitcoin mining pool with an investment of almost $500K. But I was unable to find a good mining hardware for as per requirements. The 14Th/s antminer is out of stock and I checked out a few other companies  (UFO miners, TH miners) but they all proved out to be scams. <br/>Can anyone help me out in finding the appropriate hardware for the same. Thanks in advance."
2133,2016-12-26 17:20:56.650,"Does anybody know anything about this company?<br/> It seems a bit too nice to be true, chack out especially the FAQ &quot;How long do I receive interests for?&quot; https://btclab.io/?a=faq"
2134,2016-12-25 20:02:13.233,@jsndad - well she did what we were expecting which was the retrace to 860 prev supt below 900 when she broke (was completely stopped out@900) - she ad to take a breather after all and volumes over xmas are always going to be lower than normal - I think we&#39;ll see a familiar vol pattern play out prior to everything kicking on again Tuesday/Wednesday - using the 2 week as an analysis point for the current chart 880 is the trend/860 remains support ... I have my current buy in from 865 with a stop out set for 875 (i&#39;ll continue to take smaller chunks atm ahead of revised surge however I will likely hold my position from tonight based on likely surge potential Tuesday/Wednesday)...we now have around 5-6000BTC that have taken up positions ahead of this move so looks well primed - we as ever await ;)))
2135,2016-12-25 18:10:51.810,Well it&#39;s reforming at this level
2136,2016-12-25 03:22:38.883,Stop selling you pu$$i€$
2137,2016-12-25 03:21:12.740,So @McDuff71 looks like your  charts are right as usual  it&#39;s drawing back but it&#39;s kind a like a great run in craps you make like eight passes in a row but eventually you&#39;ve got a seven out.  It will be nice for it to completely level off and stay above 800 from now on.<br/>Bad dog to treats today<br/>Gotta love this holiday single malt 40 year old scotch&#129347; &amp; nice hand rolled Dominican .

2139,2016-12-24 20:24:19.090,I think a lot of Chinese traders are convinced that a US-Chinese trade war is coming. I think they&#39;re right. The prospect of even tighter currency restrictions and devaluations in China is only adding fuel to this fire.  Throw in the India currency problems and you&#39;ve got the perfect BTC buyers market.
2140,2016-12-24 16:41:29.917,"Hi everyone, I&#39;ve just joined this forum and I&#39;m having a real Xmas buzz as the bitcoin I bought in July 2015 are basking in their snug little wallet, smiling at me reassuringly and saying &quot;you aint seen nothing yet, wait till the president elect declares his  new capital controls on the dollar.....heh heh heh&quot;, and reflecting that for once I got in at a good time!<br/><br/>What I was wondering was, which other cryptocoins should I be buying? I want to early adopt some other ones but I&#39;m a bit blagged as they say. Can anyone tell me what the smart money is buying now please?<br/><br/>All opinions and advice gratefully received and compliments of the season dear friends"

You think I should sell a couple just to be on the safe side the bigger eight goes the harder It could fall,  help me out here is this thing going to break $1000 tonight or the $15-Billion Market Cap?"

2152,2016-12-23 03:59:13.377,...@Jsndad - we need to travel back in time to June to try to gauge where this might go on trend continuation beyond the daily - mid channel has 950; lower channel 925 (my first target) upper 975...a false break now finds 860 as first support on the way back but big soak at that level which was the cue to come back in...momentum firmly with the bulls (Indian and Chinese from the looks)...we await ;)))

HOWEVER,I also despise when there is government overreach.

But, I still value privacy for the sake of privacy. Prior restraint has been rejected by the SCOTUS. Once you go down that slippery slope it&#39;s impossible to come back!<br/>insert clich&#233; ie.

His wife Rachel Is gonna make some hats for everybody &amp; ive requested a BTC hat &amp; a CryptoCompare  Hat (hope that&#39;s ok?) I know we&#39;ve discussed this before but I can&#39;t remember? and they would be for personal use only obviously. I tried to send @Kanopt a shirt a while back and it got lost along with some other stuff we tried to send to a family friend who is stationed at Ramstein AFB.  Not sure what happened there we finally used the Air Force&#39;s internal package delivery system. <br/> It is been an amazing year ever since I joined CryptoCompare things have just been aces all the way -the DAO incident but all in all wonderful year. <br/>Here&#39;s to &#129346; A stable growing BTC IN 2017 &amp; ETH &amp; Zcash having a bright new Year.<br/>Happy Holidays to All<br/>?&#127995;?&#128200;&#129346;

The chrome extension with my old Mac has been a nightmare updating the firmware on the Nano S w/ OS X Lion  froze the Nano S,  (long story Sierra not an option.) So I bought a cheap laptop at Walmart  with Windows 10, and I&#39;m awaiting a new Ledger Nano S,  however I really like the looks of the Keep Key and the Trezor, it seems to be an older unit that won&#39;t support Alt coins like Zcash BUT THATS OK.  I want to store my BTC on its own seperate hardware wallet anyway for a number of reasons, &amp; everything else (ETH, Zcash etc) on a separate unit <br/>  So in the great opinions of the people on this forum &amp; not taking cost into consideration for JUST STORING BTC on WINDOWS 10 would you guys recommend the TREZOR or KEEP KEY?  or the NANO S for BTC &amp; KEEP KEY for Alt Coins?<br/>I&#39;m leaning towards getting the Trezor for BTC and the Keep Key for everything else.  The cheap little laptop will only have the hardware wallet software/apps on it &amp; nothing else and be kept off line except for when transactions Need to be authorized with the hardware wallets.<br/>Thanks for any and all info advice and guidance happy holidays fellow Cryptonian&#39;s onward and up word.<br/>?&#127996;?"

Im trying to contain my excitement.  This is almost too good to be true I got in to bitcoin if you recall when it was right around $370-$390.  Ive had buyers remorse SEVERAL X this year, the night of the US election, w/I cashed out my Fidelity ETF &amp; transferred it all into BTC @ DAO ughhhh ( I was able to unload all of my down on politics in enough time to limit my losses) over the summer, but now yaaaaa I want to buy more.  <br/>I have a feeling (I hope) this time next year will be reminiscing about when bitcoin was under $1000 and how crazy we were for not buying as much as we could but I&#39;m going to stop &#128721; now <br/>it&#39;s all gravy now baby&#128640;<br/>&#128200;&#128200;&#128200;&#128200; <br/>Hay @McDuff71  how is your analysis looking as far as the volume and if some auto sales kicked in with people cashing out at the $800 mark (more so than just the regular pull back you might see on any type threshold eclipse) OR are you seeing people from your keen analysis standpoint running to grab it before it possibly really soars?<br/>  I know I had a lot of alarms go off &amp; price notifications flood my inbox when it surpassed $800 &amp; stayed there for several blocks in a row.<br/>------------<br/>Is it too much to ask for 2 Holiday presents<br/>1)  peaceful evacuation of Aleppo refugees <br/>2)  4 figures &#128200;&#128200;&#128200;&#128200; for BTC.<br/><br/> Happy holidays everyone, stay safe,  Count your blessings, hug your loved ones, &amp; lets all try to be just a little bit kinder to everyone.

I cannot think of a better argument in favor of Crypto Currency than what is going on in Venezuela right now. I saw a video of a man using a large wheelbarrow full of worthless fiat paper walking down the street to get in line at the bank to exchange it.  The report said that the entire value of what in $ would be millions was worth just over $7  <br/> This is a real-time example of what can happen so quickly.  Just four years ago Venezuela&#39;s economy was booming but crude oil was over $100 barrel.  Now even their upper middle-class are in a severe depression. Had they of owned just a little bit of crypto?  ( granted the crypto space was not like it is now then) My question is in emerging markets or crypto emerging markets/3rd World countries (with natural resources) i.e. Africa, S.America where you have even an upper-middle-class element, I think that that Altcoims would be VERY ATTRACTIVE?<br/><br/> Hey Vlad lets crowd fund a South American friendly exchange and wallet&#129300;&#129297;"

2193,2016-12-18 16:58:14.080,Hey @McDuff71  I know you hate price speculation so I won&#39;t ask that but when you say it&#39;s in a better place than gold you mean long-term correct?  Obviously gold is been the Safehaven when there&#39;s turmoil or unknowns in the market are you suggesting as I have thought for a while now that big coin would soon become the ultimate Safehaven when there is turmoil  and uncertainty in the markets? Or just the trend lines or both?
2194,2016-12-18 01:38:27.733,...chart looking great - vol supt looking good too - resistance @780 looks to be toast - now jacked up to 790-800 (sellers looking to exit at this mark short term - if vol surge breaks through then this sell vol should disappear and restack further up) - trend line value looks to be 780-85 atm - lets see how she trades through the week...I note that we coud be in for quite a bunt based on upcoming earnings reporting season early in the new year - global equities have run up well past earnings guidance so expect to see quite a bit of hammering in the new year when news falls and a run into BTC/crpto - this thing is better than gold imo - gltah ;)))

There is no manual included, you have to visite start.ledgerwallet.com for instructions.  or use: https://medium.com/@Ledger/ledger-blue-interface-first-look-4b452a6f2de7 <br/>The devise has a color touch screen and feels pretty solid. <br/>installation is very easy. You can choose between a new wallet or an existing wallet ( I used my recovery seed from the Nano S) . There a 2 main apps in Chrome ( BTC &amp; ETH ) for the storage of your coins. <br/>In the Bitcoin App you can also access your: DASH, DOGECOIN, ZcASH and Litecoin. <br/>With this coldwallet you have everything organized in one device and I&#39;m very pleased with this new Ledger Wallet Blue.<br/>I can highly recommend it."

2198,2016-12-15 13:54:10.400,"@McDuff71 &amp; @ZeroCool86 I was wondering what your thoughts are on interest rate hikes as they relate to BTC price &amp; volume IF ANYTHING at all? also I&#39;m interested in what  you would classify BTC if it were traded in the traditional markets? A Currency, Commodity, Neither, or Both?  A large MidCap commodity I guess?  But you run into the whole infinite (not infinite but unknown hazy guesstimates) supply of gold, oil, diamonds etc  that don&#39;t have fixed amounts other than the ones that the industries manipulate &amp; self-impose to control price. Whereas BTC, Zcash have EXACT fixed ammounts of 21 million making it unlike Fiat Currencies that print &amp; print &amp; print &amp; print backed by ??? Gold (laughable) or Commodities. So I&#39;m suggesting that Crypto Currency (with fixed total supply&#39;s) /smart contract&#39;s (This Space) really are a new unlabeled category of asset.  <br/>What troubles me somewhat  is what is BTC backed by Really, when you get down to it? Other than the faith we all have in the blockchain, community, &amp; in BTC case it&#39;s Phoenix li,e  resilience coming back from crash. BUT just like the US dollar only real value is that faith right? ( and known limited supply)  Id be interested to hear your thoughts @McDuff71 &amp; Vlad.<br/>???"

HOWEVER, I think a lot of that&#39;s been weeded out at this point.  After the $1200 days &amp; the crash and now the Slower solid bounce back its on stronger legs.<br/> I think the people that are still here and entering now are not going to be so quick to sell especially as less and less become available because of shrinking supply I&#39;m hopeful that it will just continue to inch up little by little over the years.<br/> I&#39;m not really going to use it as a Currency anymore but more as a long-term savings devise for my kids."

About 90 days ago I pulled ALL my $ (small amount of money)  out of all of my defense industry stocks which were flat and moved it over to crypto and I was celebrating my brilliance especially the night of Trumps victory when the markets seemed to be crashing all over the world &amp; BTC was on the rise. AND then the market rallied to HISTORIC HIGHS  and just the last three weeks.

2227,2016-12-03 03:22:55.357,...the chart for this move has been brewing since the sharp correction down to 500/550 and then subsequent phases of consolidation since - the nice thing is that the speculative shunt to previous 750 level has been brought back into smoother trend on more even volume - the next test for this is continuing volume and for how long  which will ultimately set a new support base (back track) heading into the year end...770/80 break is important because of the sell in vols at this level - should these wind off and the price is allowed to run then we could well see a break towards 1k however I would speculate that a move to this level would warrant some coming off the table.. a move downward from here is likely to settle 730...have fun everyone ;)) - p.s - any macro fators i.e yuan deval or curency collapse elsewhere will naturally support/shunt these levels...

I guess if they didn&#39;t get out after the last crash there certainly not gonna get out now right ?  I would think that this very small time investors like myself who may be bought in around the thousand dollar plus Mark probably cut their losses a long time ago maybe not?<br/> Anyone know if there are any specific indicators that Have driven it up in the last 30 days to this level? or is it just the general unknown trend of things?

2254,2016-11-18 16:11:34.307,Hey @Jelko are you a miner  The reason I ask is because you post a lot of stuff about buying bitcoin like I do I&#39;m not a miner I wanted to and looked into it SEVERAL TIMES &amp; bugged Vlad about it so much I think he is sick of me??? I decided to just buy the darn stuff I think I five years ago it was feasible to actually make a go of it but now with hash power rates and difficulty so high  it just makes more sense to me to put all that money and it coin itself but I really love the idea of mining it even if it was just to break even .
2255,2016-11-18 11:53:01.177,going up!!!
2256,2016-11-18 06:00:37.903,"I concur Jelko  especially with most if not all fiat currencies going down in value besides the dollar, it will become a  Safehaven and like you said it may not be next month next year or even in five years but it absolutely will be ONE DAY and as I&#39;ve said from the beginning the thing I&#39;ve always loved about it is that there is a FINITE amount there&#39;s only 21 million of them (actually less-lost unretrievable coins)  we don&#39;t know how much gold is actually really out in the market or how much is still in the ground to be mine but we do know how many big ones there will ever be in the history of the world. <br/> Frankly I&#39;m surprised that at this point the billionaire class haven&#39;t come in and bought up a huge share like Saudi Prince&#39;s &amp; the like.  Instead of putting the $300 I had been for years in a stock ETF share builder plan. I totally  liquidated all stocks kept a few municipal bonds and am going to just put it into Bitcoin going forward  and the first of the month when I get my SSI.<br/>&#129300;&#127464;&#127475;<br/>."
2257,2016-11-17 20:45:41.337,"I came to the realization a week or so ago that I can no longer invest in altcoins. 95% of my crypto investment has all been converted into Bitcoin and that will not change for a very long time. I&#39;ve also committed to buying a certain amount per month. And when we pay off my wife&#39;s car next month we will not instantly go looking for a new one, I will buy more bitcoin. <br/><br/>I&#39;m going to buy up all the btc I can, mainly on dips. Because I know, no matter when it is, when the price does reach the next pricing tier that it&#39;s nearly out of the reach for your everyday man to buy one -- I&#39;ll have nowhere near as much as I hoped for.<br/><br/>If the price drops $350 I won&#39;t get discouraged, I&#39;ll buy twice as much. But one of the things that really did it for me was sitting down and truly thinking about how much people were paying for zcash at first release. I mean regardless whether it was the developers pumping it up or not, so many people joined in. I seriously felt like it was a glimpse into the future of bitcoin, especially as more and more find out and the closer we get to 21 million."

This is just the reports that we know about.  CNET reported rumors of the same type of thing about Samsung in 2014  according to an old report at them in the Washington Post. <br/> The larger question I have for you guys is obviously cold storage and password security all of those things but if they have all that information anyway stored &quot;somewhere&quot; how safe really is our Bitcoin? (If I entered in my passwords on a device or had them in i-notes or something else on these devices even briefly at some point) <br/>I&#39;m not trying to be alarmist but IF the Trump administration starts a Currency war with China are Americans and Europeans BTC and other Alt coins really safe even in &quot;so-called&quot; cold storage.  In the event that we have a full on Cold War/ Currency war with China (if not in the near future but the distant future) being that they control the BTC market?<br/>Look we all know that everybody is spying on everybody &amp; NOTHING is safe but I&#39;m kind of worried even more now that I might wake up one day &amp; my BTC is just gone, and I have to fill my truck with bags worthless US dollar notes just to go buy a loaf of bread at the store.  Or at least my grandkids might have to someday.<br/> Please no arrogant scolding of my ignorance I am just concerned and wondering y&#39;alls thoughts."

So at the time looking at Dow futures down 800 points, Wall Street possibly closing today for business I went against his advice and bought 4 more BTC now I got to go move money &amp; figure out how to pay for it.  The market stabilized for the most part &amp; BTC is flat and down from what I bought at  last night <br/> My point is the creator of this amazing Forum has been right about everything I have ever asked him about crypto currency and other things so when he speaks {you all should listen} because he has been right every single time and I will NEVER AGAIN go against his advice.<br/>?????   stay safe over in Eastern Europe guys"

There is a lot of division at the moment and that&#39;s a bad thing, but... It&#39;s a bad thing that benefits alterntives like BTC and Gold.<br/><br/>So my advice, unlike most of the libertarian people I know, is to go and vote. No matter who wins, if you vote, you&#39;ll find it eaiser to live with the outcome.<br/><br/>Also, again, no matter who wins, if you think this election cycle is bad...

Traditionally they have always stayed away to allow for a smoother transition with a new administration  if anything they lower them but can&#39;t really go below zero. <br/> So my question is what is going on in China right now I think would make BTC even more desirable would it not???If something is harder to get, it has more intrinsic value????   The thing I do like about BTC is that  it has been through the fire and come out the other side stronger &amp; survived I will NEVER sell mine.

We have seen the volatility in the market&#39;s at least in the US rebound in the last 72 hours, oil is still tanking ( as a non-investor I think it&#39;s great for us at the pump) gold is flat but with BTC  all of those things I would think I don&#39;t know I&#39;m asking but I would think are irrelevant to the price of Tea (BTC) in China."

So does that mean they&#39;re going to force them to sell and convert it  into Chinese currency or what?  I don&#39;t really get it can you guys explain why that would cause a  cataclysmic collapse or fall in price?  unless they&#39;re forced to convert all the BTC in China it to their own New Chinese digital currency then I would understand it.  Is that the threat that they will sell it off in foreign markets and make them convert it into some Chinese only digital currency??? but if they do that won&#39;t the HUHE LABOR FORCE want to be paid in that instead of the CONSTANTLY devalued Chinese Yen?

I get the whole nature of the BTC mining requirements -- but the whole concentration of mining horsepower in a few unknown and anonymous organizations - unknown to the general public - around the world but highly concentrated in China will create a perfect storm if the BTC ecosystem has a major hiccup. Virtually every Crypto including ETH, ETC, XMR, XRP, you name it, is dependent either directly of indirectly on BTC liquidity to function. , Example -- for a whole slew of cryptos --- you can only purchase the pair via BTC.

2381,2016-09-14 23:24:34.117,Hey guys do you ever foresee a day where bit coin would split say hypothetically and hopefully it gets to over $1000 or more and like so many stocks and other things they split it so that more people can afford to come in and buy 1 or 2 of them?  I know that obviously it&#39;s done in parcels and decimals now but if that were to ever happen how would something like that work there&#39;s not really a controlling border of way of voting like there was SUPPOSED to be on the DAO?<br/><br/> Secondly well I&#39;m on here I was just curious what you guys think about DASH I am thinking about buying about five of them and I just googled DASH wallets and found one at Dash.com I&#39;m attempting to do a polo trade by a few right now any thoughts about itS future. Personally I like the security everyone assumes just because you want privacy that you&#39;re up to no good it really pisses me off that there&#39;s that assumption that privacy =  illegal or  illicit activity

This is good news that shows that they feel bit coin is solid enough to be part of their pension portfolio because they especially are very conservative with their investments the majority of that particular pension fund is made up of VERY LARGE Capitol stocks &quot;slow &amp; steady&quot; movers. GE, APPLE, etc.  they&#39;ve moved away from exon and the big oil companies because those have become even more volatile than crypto currency.<br/> My point is if this becomes a trend some of the larger unions may start to invest which could really stabilize the bottom &amp; only push the price up. BTC is obviousely the gold standard but instead of a Currency  it could be moving towards a safe haven like gold is now and not really used as a Currency but a long term secure investment product due to the fact that there is a FINITE ammount of BTC &amp; pave the way for alt coins to become the new  &quot;everyday currency&quot; like ETH or DASH ????<br/>Please Opine."

I personally have used 2 different sites that I have actually been able to withdraw my interests from and it has been earning exactly what they say they do. Check them out I have listed the links below. Of course these are my refferal links and I would appreciate if you used them, however feel free to take the ref part of the link out and sign up on your own. If you use my link you will earn the same i will just get a small bit of extra instead of the site owners. Anyway check below I have 2 sites Mbitco and Hashwave. Mbitco offers several different plans from 1 day to 5 days all the way up to 40 days with interest rates from %4 all the way to %1000, be aware the interest at this site does not accrue until the plan time is up. Hashwave on the other hand offers hourly interest and you can just more than double your deposit if you stay for the whole 30 days. I have not been here for 30 days yet but I have withdrawn my interest every hour for the few days I have been there with no problems and it is generating it as stated. At any rate please feel free to check them out here:<br/><br/>https://mbitco.com/<br/><br/><br/>https://hashwave.io/<br/><br/>Also all tips are greatly appreciated so if you find these sites help you and are what you are looking for and want to send a tip my way then by all means please do ;) 13ukAFSUjdBV5Uaxxo5ei6sy7RgTduksRb<br/><br/><br/>P.S. If your skeptical like I was at first then just do the minimum deposit and see if it works as it states thats what I did and now I am promoting it lol.....Happy Investing!"

2405,2016-08-19 08:15:11.093,"1. Short term analysis :<br/>1.1. ETC will crash as it is not a serious concept, without concrete roadmap.  ETC is Just a copy of ETH, no matter the philosophical debates and good reasons to oppose the HF on ETH.  If Ethereum foundation had patents for its creation, ETC &#39;promoters&#39; could have been sued for copying the concept of ETH, simply.  Worth nothing on the long term. <br/>1.2.  ETH will not go well during this period either :<br/>&gt;&gt; The DAO and ETC &#39;black swan&#39; will continue to impact market confidence.  Situation may improve when ETC will crash to reach a low position in market cap (around the 10th crypto market cap, with price around 0,3 USD). <br/>&gt;&gt; The market sentiment is that there was exaggerated confidence about DAPPs and  that the society is not yet ready to embrace them.  It&#39;s too early and that&#39;s why I fear a bubble, the same as for Bitcoin in late 2013 and a price correction to 6 USD.<br/>No matter the promising technology behind Ethereum, It&#39;s obvious ETH is still in the &quot;Peak of Inflated expectation&quot; on the Hype-Cycle : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Hype-Cycle-General.png<br/>1.3.  Bitcoin will end its downward trend and recover :<br/>&gt;&gt; Simply as an hedging reflex, when ETH &amp; ETC both go down<br/>&gt;&gt; It remains the #1, with all the network effect associated<br/>&gt;&gt; The &#39;block size&#39; debate seems to evolve in a positive way : http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-software-version-0-13-0-segwit-code/<br/>&gt;&gt; Bitcoin will behave more and more as a &#39;blue chip&#39; of crypto-currencies.  It&#39;s a paradox, considering the high volatility history, but things are changing quickly and in relative terms Vs other cryptos, yes, BTC will become a &#39;conservative&#39; asset.<br/>&gt;&gt; On the Hype-Cycle, Bitcoin has reached the plateau of productivity for its unique and unambiguous use case : Payment.<br/>&gt;&gt; Its use case is more primitive than Ethereum, much more.  But it does much better at on this unique Use Case than Ethereum does for its owns.<br/>2. Longer Term analysis :<br/>2.1. ETH will slowly recover with announcements of Devcon2, new use cases, and grow faster around mid 2017 with the emergence of use cases with real fundamental interest in private sector (that generates money, finally).<br/>2.2. BTC will continue to grow, especially in case of economic turmoil (which I fear more and more.  Look at the US interest rates, the nearly 20 trillion USD debt in the US, the ratio USD debt / GDP at its highest since WW2, the &#39;de-dollarisation&#39; of world central banks, the growing anti wall-street front of China-Russia-Iran-Turkey(new!)-...)<br/>And on the very long term, I fear a &quot;Rootstock&quot; option to mount smart contracts on BTC, combined with more efficient mining (smaller blocks) and off-chain transaction would make Bitcoin the supreme crypto-currency and Turing-Complete virtual machine that will govern the entire society.<br/>Ultimately, I wish you good luck in your investment guys ! And for those who don&#39;t like trading, just go long BTC and ETH for the long term ;-)"

Within the new model, maker fee is set to 0%. This is a major improvement to encourage even higher liquidity across CEX.IO markets.<br/><br/>What is Maker-Taker?<br/> <br/>If we take a closer look at the order execution, we can see that each trade involves two parties: the maker, who places the order in the order book, and the taker, who “takes” or matches the maker’s order. In a nutshell, makers create liquidity on the market, and provided that they play a longer game, they are usually rewarded with lower fees than takers. Takers, in their turn, use liquidity from the market by matching makers’ orders, which drives market movement and lead to tighter market spread.<br/><br/>How does Maker-Taker Fee System Work on CEX.IO?<br/><br/>The new fee structure on CEX.IO implies 0% trade fee for makers and standard 0.2% fee for takers on all trade pairs. Special trade conditions are discussable for high-volume traders, Verified Plus and Corporate accounts. Shortly, we will improve the Maker-Taker model by making it volume-tiered.<br/><br/>We highly welcome you to take advantage of the new fee schedule. In our turn, we’ll do our best to provide the best experience of cryptocurrency trading for you, as usual.<br/><br/>https://cex.io/"

2444,2016-08-04 01:38:28.293,&#128200; I&#39;m not pleased to meet you &amp; I think I can guess your name. What&#39;s puzzling me is the nature of you game Digital Graffiti or Whoever has been doing this state sponsored hacking trying to whipe out us small timers/miners. Well some of us are STILL HERE you fuckers. You&#39;ll have to take my BTC &amp; ETH private key out of my cold dead hands. Or maybe email Coinbase tell them your me &amp; they&#39;ll probably email you my pass key in 3 weeks.&#128539; <br/>That said  I sold a little bit of my bitcoin on Monday night and it went into my bank account and hour ago but it&#39;s ialmost back to 600 got out at $639.  I don&#39;t know what to do I&#39;m actually cheering for it to go down a little bit I tried to buy at $495 but CB wouldn&#39;t let me.
2445,2016-08-03 14:36:36.213,"Well I take yor point &amp; your right @amennenc  the fact that an exchanges/wallets can&#39;t guarantee depositors funds (not price) like the FDIC  is the reason why this industry will never grow unless you can get security around it to prevent this kind of thing. If Bank of America is hacked they don&#39;t shutter the windows &amp; doors lock up &amp; stop withdrawls.  If WE in the crypto space want to operate in that world we&#39;re going to have to get safer somehow.  And these exchanges/wallets need to have enough capital, insurance, or something on hand to handle this kind of crisis whether they throttle or slow down transactions like Coinbase did last night but you can&#39;t just close the doors.  It makes crypto look like the JV team which we are but we&#39;re trying to get better. Are you the PR rep for BitFimex?"
2446,2016-08-03 13:55:26.730,"Stretch:  Was widely reported there was a hijack of on the exchange BitFinex. Which is the worlds largest bitcoin / BTC-USD exchange.  Most reputable trading firms have rules and policies in place that automatically halt ALL trading if there is an anomaly in the blockchain.  This is a &quot;failsafe&quot;  It stops people from making brash and uninformed decisions because of the anomaly.  I would expect within the next few hours; once the scope of the problem has been identified, trading will resume.. The resumption will absolutely pick back up exactly where it halted, in hopes to ease fears of traders to stabilze their portfolios.<br/><br/>There is ABSOLUTLY the GOLDEN RULE happening.... Don&#39;t put in what you cant afford to lose.  If you don&#39;t follow that rule; and can not wait out the wave; then I would submit, you should have never been here to begin with.<br/><br/>You should understand there is NO security or safetynet that prevents you from losing everything you put in.  The only way to ensure that is to be a watcher and not a player..<br/><br/>Stay the course and let the Exchange admins analyze and investigate.... Patience being the operative word here; given the technology and the very fact this exact technology is absent of ANY governmental intervention. I am 100% confident that then end of the day this issue will be resolved; yes probably some will lose some money; in the same breath, some will make money; but in the end if you sell out and dump your wallet, you absolutely will lose and will have no one to blame but yourself... <br/><br/>I am not trying to stir emotion or point fingers, but giving the hard truth about this....   Please don&#39;t start a war of word or finger pointing... that will accomplish nothing...  This is just my opinion and worth exactly what has been paid for it...  :-)<br/><br/>Have a great day!"

The reduction applies only on volumes over 0.01 so it does not affect smaller coins and the volume is reduced as follows:<br/>reductionOnTime = {Over5Min:0.8,Over10Min:0.6,Over15Min:0.4,Over20Min:0.2,Over25Min:0.01}<br/><br/>So that means that if the last trade was <br/>between 5 and 10 min ago, we only take 80% of the volume into account<br/>between 10 and 15 min ago, we only take 60% of the volume into account<br/>between 15 and 20 min ago, we only take 40% of the volume into account<br/>between 20 and 25 min ago, we only take 20% of the volume into account<br/>over 25 min ago, we only take 0.1% into account<br/><br/>Normally the price would not be affected as the highest volume exchange was the one that traded the most, today, with Bifinex offline for over 1 hour and with the highest volume, it had a big impact on the average price before the change."

Unfortunately, as stated in the contract, we cannot reduce the maintenance fee because it is associated to the machines that we purchased with your investment. Your machines have fixed electricity, maintenance, cooling and hosting costs during their productive life....<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>if use some math:<br/><br/>payout before halving = mined - maintenance fee   <br/>payout after halving = mined/2 - maintenance fee = (mined - 2*maintenance fee) / 2 <br/><br/>example:<br/><br/>before: mined 15btc - 5btc maint. fee = 10btc payout<br/>now: mined 7.5btc - 5btc maint. fee = 2.5btc payout<br/><br/>happy cloud mining!"

Is that one of those like hidden secret Chinese exchanges or could I go on there with a few of my bitcoins send &amp;  transfer it back through polo with my $120 difference &amp; buy ETH or whatever with the difference.  I get there will be variations within exchanges but they&#39;re all around $5 to $10 apart this is $120 plus?

What am I missing this seems too good to be true? I&#39;ve checked it several times is the H/s difficulty about to explode on bitcoin?  I thought if anything it would level off with reward @ 12.5 now.  So basically  4 BTC PER YEAR for next 4 years then say 2 per year for the next 4. If all the numbers are right the ROI WOULD BE PAID BACK BY THE 9th MONTH of first year. Then it would ALL be profit from there on out. For a one time $1600 fee!.

2535,2016-07-07 04:30:55.917,"Just remember there are a finite # of Bitcoins that will ever be created. As @jerdalance points out The  Federal Reserve is printing money at an astronomical rate (wonder how many toners they go through a day &#129297;&#129300;) Come Saturday more than 75% of ALL BTC will have been mined &amp; the Fed will continue to print on average 1 billion in fiat Currency PER DAY. I think the absolute key is more vendors accepting it.  I&#39;m really surprised the PayPal thing hasn&#39;t gotten more attention. I paid my Dish Network Bill yesterday with bitcoin.  But 12 years from now when the reward is 1.56 I don&#39;t think will be using BTC that way anymore.  But rather a safe haven from inflation like gold is now.<br/>INFLATION IS INEVITABLE when there is an INFINATE AMOUNT of fiat out there backed by NOTHING. But BTC is because there is a FINITE AMOUNT. <br/>UNLESS there is a way to split, resplit, &amp; on &amp; on. I would Like to see bitcoin used as a REAL currency. <br/><br/>So for example you take BTC if &amp; when it reaches say $1000 &amp; then do a 10x split so now if you had 2 BTC now you would have 20 worth $100 each &amp;  then it can be used as a currency more realistically and the price can still continue to go up until it reaches another high and then split again. ( they&#39;ve been doing that for years with stocks but in this case there is a truly fixed amount) whether you call them Mini BTC  or Small Satoshi&#39;s Bits whatever you want.<br/> If something like that is not done barring any unforeseen crazy events happening the majority of all bitcoins will be mined in the next five years realistically.  The  average lower income person can&#39;t afford to set up an account and buy a few BTC to utilize as true currency to buy a cup of coffee or pay for a haircut, everyday items etc.<br/>The way it is set up now it will become more and more unattainable by those without the means.  I know people on this forum can&#39;t imagine it but there are a lot of people who do not have a computer or reliable Internet service in their homes AT ALL.  I&#39;m not talking about Third World Africa I&#39;m talking about right here in the southwest United States I personally know several people who do not have internet in there homes, or a smart phone it&#39;s seen as a luxury. Going forward Federal governments, States,and municipalities need to make that available to everyone as a necessity or utility like running water, not just for commerce but for everything. <br/><br/> I don&#39;t want BTC &amp; Crypto to only be for the upper-middle-class and people who have the means. It should be available to everybody. I guess alternate coins can serve that purpose some what but they are just too volatile &amp; if bitcoin merchant adoption has been slow imagine how long it will be until Starbucks accepts ETH, DASH, OR LiteCoin.<br/>Anyhoo Food for thought--- BTC will probably crash Sunday night down to  $150 and this will all be a mute  point."

I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s wrong I just am curious.  When it comes to crypto currency I have used gold models I&#39;ve used old tech bubble models, but none of them seem to fit. Because it reacts so differently, &amp; china&#39;s upper class is such a big player but they devalue their currency so it&#39;s almost a reverse as to what the US $, DOW, Nasdaq, or precious medals, markets do. Look at oil, &amp; gold after Markets after &quot;BREXIT&quot; global scared markets ran to gold &amp; sold oil futures, (AS NORMAL) BTC should of been a safe haven for scared investors???? But it wasn&#39;t, Crypto doesn&#39;t act like any other investment product,  I don&#39;t think anybody really knows because it doesn&#39;t follow any of the other pattern.

They normally do 4-6% on other investment options/products, but are going to do 8 percent for the first year on BTC  to entice Railroad employees to try it out.<br/> I think it&#39;s proof that Warren Buffet has embraced BTC even if he dident buy 500K BTC last month.

2566,2016-06-30 19:02:42.647,"The big question is: how can we collaborate to increase the amount of BTC in our personal caches? <br/><br/>There is scheme I am contemplating (scheme for some of you--is a commonly-used term that has a positive connotation). As an introduction, let&#39;s take a look backward as to where this all began. During the 2000s I became intrigued by Forex trading but realized that the top of the food chain was to be the Broker. The Broker scores revenue whether the trade goes up or down based on spreads. The trader has all the capital at risk. Well -- the Hammerin&#39; Hank debacle and huge regulatory wave that followed resulted in huge capital requirements being imposed on IBs (Introducing Brokers) of Forex Trading exchanges. I was an IB and had just set up a managed FX fund as an LLC. We developed a trading partner relationship out of Chicago, but then FINRA came out with new regs that killed our enterprise. Fast forward to today. Now with BTC being listed on newer exchanges there are intriguing opportunities. Would some of you brilliant minds out there want to make contact to form an IBC and white-label as an IB to actually help BTC traders in the options arena? My web investigations have uncovered some linkages that if we brought the components together we could help ourselves and others, I believe, win big in the next few years as BTC continues to mature. Your comments and sagacious remarks would be appreciated."

And then they set their own price and each of them is slightly different. <br/><br/>So my real question is: how is this any different than fiat currencies with big banks and the federal reserve or the &quot;petro dollar&quot;? Or the price of precious metals?

I know the winklevoss twins own gemini, supposedly, but maybe they&#39;re just following suite? <br/><br/><br/>Does anyone else think about these kinds of things? and what are your thoughts?

2662,2016-06-12 18:02:19.567,@ZC86 @Cryptobond @Kanopt @wolf  to the brain trust is this QUICK SURGE like how stocks shoot up based upon estimated earnings but when earnings reports come out in there either negative or positive the bubble has already been created good or bad &amp; the market is ahead.  For instance when a Bluechip stock meets sales projections it doesn&#39;t really go up because people bought it thinking it would whereas if it does not meet projections it only goes down.  My question is should I move some money out of 401(k) and by say 10 bitcoins do you guys feel confident that the floor is say $400 or is this like the previous run up to $1200 and then crash. I know no one has the answer just best educated guess to me is this like the previous run up to $1200 (I wasn&#39;t into crypt then) and then CATOSTROFIC crash?

But the risk of having that much money in an exchange where it could be somewhat vulnerable for that type of ROI isn&#39;t really worth it to me. You said you get about 1% So if you loan out 20K in a month you make $20?  I guess it&#39;s better than nothing though.

The device uses the company’s new 16nm ASIC chips BM1387 and essentially triples the hashrate of the previous generation S7 miners while offering the same level of power usage. The Bitmain AntMiner S9 should be capable of 14 THS SHA-256 mining hashrate with a power usage of 1375 Watts at the wall, so definitely a good improvement over the S7.<br/><br/>So it might be wise to wait for a later batch of S9 miners after the halving to see how the situation will change and if you might get a better deal in terms of price for the hardware. Then again if you are using S7 miners you might already get to the planning for switching to S9 now that the previous generation S5 is no longer profitable barely covering the electricity costs.<br/><br/>Bitmain AntMiner S9 Specifications:<br/>– Hash Rate: 14.0 THS &#177;5%<br/>– Power Consumption: 1375W + 7% (at the wall, with APW3 ,93% efficiency, 25C ambient temp)<br/>– Power Efficiency: 0.098 J/GH + 7% (at the wall, with APW3 93% efficiency, 25&#176;C ambient temp)<br/>– Rated Voltage: 11.60~13.00V<br/>– Chip quantity per unit: 189x BM1387<br/>– Dimensions: 350mm(L)*135mm(W)*158mm(H)<br/>– Cooling: 2x 12038 fan<br/>– Operating Temperature: 0 &#176;C to 40 &#176;C<br/>– Network Connection: Ethernet<br/>– Default Frequency: 650 MHz"

2783,2016-03-15 07:47:35.533,"A Singapore-based startup, SearchTrade, has introduced a system to allow all parties in the Internet search engine process – the searcher, the owner of the key word being searched, the builder of the app using the search engine, and the advertisers – to profit from the process using bitcoin. Using bitcoin, the system redistributes the revenue among the stakeholders in the process, rather than allowing all the profit to flow to the big search engines like Google and Bing.<br/><br/>“Search is the single most important activity on the Internet,” said Vishal Gupta, co-founder and CEO of SearchTrade. Everyone does it, every day. Search drives far more traffic than any social network or viral news site, and it makes a ton of money.<br/><br/>We&#39;re asking people to imagine how much better the Internet would be if everyone could share the benefits of that activity.&quot;<br/><br/>Bitcoin micro-payments make it possible for all stakeholders in the search process a share in the income generated, Gupta said.<br/><br/>The four stakeholders are:<br/><br/>The person doing the search<br/>The person who “owns” a keyword being searched<br/>The builders of apps that use the search platform<br/>The advertisers who pay to advertise among the search results.<br/>SearchTrade takes the revenues paid by the advertisers and pays the other three parties, proportionate to their role in the process.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>SearchTrade uses a search engine based on existing platforms and is building its own additions. Gupta said developers are building more localized options since he wants to give users as much choice as possible.<br/><br/>Three Ways To Earn Bitcoin<br/><br/>Stakeholders can earn payments in three ways:<br/><br/>1. By searching. Performing a search earns the user a small fraction of a bitcoin, which goes into the user&#39;s wallet.<br/><br/>2. By “owning” key words. SearchTrade provides an exchange platform for users to buy and sell key words. Users can buy key words they think will be popular in searches. Each time someone searches that term, the system rewards the “owner.” The key word prices are set by the open market.<br/><br/>3. By building web and mobile apps that use SearchTrade&#39;s platform. Developers earn bitcoins when a user performs a search using their app, when searcher is signed-up as SearchTrade user.<br/><br/>SearchTrade is seeking developers to build hundreds of apps that include its search facilities. About a quarter of the revenue is shared among these developers.<br/><br/>SearchTrade limits the number of searches per user to 40 per day. This is to deter “click farms” – operations that game advertising systems by using them 24/7 using cheap labor. SearchTrade also limits access to individual IP addresses.<br/><br/><br/>Articles<br/><br/>Cointelegraph - Search Your Way to Millions?

Then take a Bitcoin!<br/>Benzinga- Bitcoin 2.0 Start-Up With Plans To Disrupt Google&#39;s Search Business Raises Over $40K In A Week<br/><br/>Company Name : Searchtrade.com Pte Ltd registered in Singapore<br/>Directors :<br/>Vishal Gupta : https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishalgupta99 <br/>Rashmit Gupta : https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rashmit-gupta/7/347/9a<br/><br/>WebSite : www.Searchtrade.com<br/><br/>Introduction Video : <br/>Search Mining Video : <br/>Keyword Mining Video : <br/>Application Mining Video : <br/><br/><br/>How does it work?<br/><br/>Platform collects all revenue from : Ad Sales, Keyword Trading Commission, Renewal Fees, Affiliate income and pushes it into Searchtrade Community Pool. From there pool will track average income per search that platform is able to generate every 24hrs and decide what average payout per search should be. The cycle of pool calculating payout will have to reduce over period of time with increase in traffic so as to ensure pool never runs out of money.<br/><br/>That way income generated from Keyword sale to advertiser and Income distributed to keyword owner is de-linked from each other.<br/><br/>At launch we will use btc collected from presale to give payout. lets say @ 400 satoshis per search. Which means each stake holder Search User, Keyword owner, App Developer and Searchtrade itself will get 100 Satoshi&#39;s to begin with. Post this as traffic increases and we start generating ad income along with other sources of income we switch system to auto decide payout based on algorithm defined above. <br/><br/>General Queries &amp; Accusations<br/><br/>A. Are we a ponzi scheme or genuine business? there is no way to judge peoples intentions and proof of pudding is in eating it.<br/><br/>B. We have been working on this since two years and have built team of 50 developers.<br/><br/>C. Payout alters on a simple math that will evolve over time to keep pool profitable at all times. <br/><br/>Current math : Total searches / total income / number of users / 90 = payout <br/><br/>D. Keyword Pre-sale prices will reduce after every sale based on slabs (Predefined) since all keywords cant make same amount of money and it is common sense that people buying first will target best keywords.<br/><br/>E. Funds that we have collected get scattered in multiple wallets to protect both us and our users from attacks. We take fund safety seriously.<br/><br/>F. Keywords owners can trade keywords with each other so trade-able value of keyword could be higher than actual income it makes. E.G. if Word bitcoin had earning of 100$ a year it could be traded in multiples of 10 and be valued at 1000$ as it would imply 10% return on investment.<br/><br/>G.

Bitcoin Address Tools is a passphrase that converts into a wallet without the use of a wallet file. This passphrase is only stored in the mind of the wallet holder; it acts as an access mechanism to your wallet’s private key. <br/><br/>Bitcoin Address Tools is created simply by starting with a unique phrase. The phrase must be sufficiently long to prevent brute-force guessing - a short password, a simple phrase, or a phrase taken from published literature is likely to be stolen by hackers who use computers to quickly try combinations. A suggestion is to take a memorable phrase and change it in a silly way that is difficult to predict.<br/><br/>The phrase is turned into a 256-bit private key with a hashing or key derivation algorithm (example: SHA256). That private key is then used to compute a Bitcoin address, or a deterministic sequence of addresses. <br/><br/>Features : Random Generator, Passpharse, Mini Private Key, Private Key (WIF) to address, Secret Exponent, Hash 160, Public Key, Private Key (DER)<br/><br/>Screenshort  : http://i.imgur.com/kvmPTH5.png<br/><br/>Donate : 1G3CoLPKMzyw461XQenJf21fDDkmnSBS9R<br/><br/>Download : <br/>- https://www.sendspace.com/file/74jjdq<br/>- https://www.sendspace.com/file/aykzgl<br/>Mirror<br/>- http://rghost.net/75GBCQWWn<br/>- http://rghost.net/72QvSc5t9"

2827,2016-01-15 03:10:14.740,I&#39;ve been following the Chinese markets does anyone know if the reason BTC is dropping slightly over last 2 weeks is because Chinese investors are selling off some of their BTC  to offset their losses in the markets there?  Lastly when does the mining share get halved July 2016?

I hope i did not offend anyone with the Bitcoin Core Development drama section. https://www.cryptocompare.com/email-updates/daily/2016/jan/8/ . <br/><br/>I also hope that we find a common enemy to fight as a community, there are probably a lot, and not fight so much between ourselves. It does no good to anyone and it just creates tension. There have been a lot of positive news around Bitcoin lately and the price has been slowly and more important relatively steadily going up for the past 4 months, let&#39;s all take a breather and be happy for a second. It&#39;s not that we have ever asked for approval from the old industry, but now we are finally, slowly getting more and more people to see the potential and promote Bitcoin.<br/><br/>Let&#39;s enjoy this while it lasts (the price increase i mean, Bitcoin is here to stay forever!), there is enough bad publicity and drama from outside the community, let&#39;s not create more ourselves as well."

2844,2016-01-02 06:58:23.427,"Bitcoin will go higher this 2016. As everyone here knows (or almost 99% of all bitcoin traders), the bitcoin mining program was designed so that the reward would be halved around every 4 years (the reward has already been reduce by half once last November 2012, from 50 to 25 BTC), so that it could keep a lid on inflation. The next time that the reward halving will happen is estimated around 6 months from now, around July 2016. So that will be 25 to 12.5. Due to that fact we can expect that the price will go high, perhaps it will double up to $800.00 or more likely around $1000+ USD again.<br/><br/>And according to some experts it will reach more than $4000 USD per Bitcoin by 2017. It sounds too good to be true, but most likely it will happen. Haha!<br/><br/>Time to invest more now while it&#39;s still at $430+, because it will never go down below $400. Maybe by next month, it will be steady at $500+.<br/><br/>2015 is a good year, 2016 is a better year, and 2017 will be a great year for bitcoin! :D"
2845,2016-01-01 05:39:04.460,A few hours into 2016 and BTC is looking good 3% up in the last 24 hours and over $ 115.07 (35.99%) up in 2015. So i guess you could say 2015 was a good year for Bitcoin. Let&#39;s hope it does at lest as well in 2016!

That&#39;s not bad at all. Now let&#39;s see if this momentum stays. The charts look positive, even the last week one is not that bad, with only a $-15.9 (-3.62%) loss.
