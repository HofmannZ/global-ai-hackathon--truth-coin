The current situation is that bitcoin is still largely a speculative tool and an investment, which is good. I invest bitcoin for the long term as well and hold it to store my wealth away from prying eyes. Bitcoin is incredibly useful for this. It is also used to transact online, and is also easier and much more secure than credit cards which can get into the wrong hands easily.,However most people that accept bitcoin accepts it on the basis that it can be converted to fiat in real time via a service such as Bitpay.

If bitcoin can transact in real life as well as online, it'll make it much more useful and therefore give it a much better chance of gaining mass adoption.,Agreed, it's best to save BTC for overseas transactions for now."

This is where the problem lies.

In other words, no more hype (which gave rise to recent steep rally) and thus no more high fees (due to people transacting less). Further, the price is determined on exchanges, and these don't involve fees besides initial deposits. But after you move your funds to your exchange account, you no longer care for the fees. The bottom line is that lower fees will hardly make the price rise on their own. Quite the contrary, they may in fact be a circumstantial evidence of future price decline"

deisik,#22,Re: 0-10 Byte fees starting to clear up from the mempool,"June 19, 2017, 04:19:55 PM","You are missing the whole picture,If we assume that fees correlate with the number of transactions (which seems to be a pretty solid assumption) and this number is going down (in the long term, obviously, apart from usual variation), it means that Bitcoin is used less, i.e. it loses its appeal and value. I can't possibly see how that could mean higher prices. If we talk about daily volatility, people may transact more, of course, since they are most likely moving funds to buy the dips and sell the highs, but if the number of transactions gradually declines over time (together with fees) this in general doesn't bode well for Bitcoin"

I think the sex/adult industry is missing out by not accepting bitcoin. They could save a lot on fees and I know companies like Paypal wont even work with adult content. ,Agreed. Payments are instant. I've never had to worry about not receiving my coins the second after the payment was sent as I've never had any double spends so I don't think this is an issue. Besides, a payment processor would cover against this but I don't think it's necessary."

d5000,#4,Re: What is Bitcoin Rootstock?,"May 15, 2017, 07:04:21 PM","Rootstock is a smart contract platform implemented as a sidechain of Bitcoin. It provides a similar functionality than Ethereum, but using a token that is pegged to Bitcoin - so it doesn't affect Bitcoin's value/price because it's not competing with it.,A sidechain is an independent blockchain, but it provides a ""link"" to the Bitcoin blockchain. In the case of Rootstock we are talking of a ""pegged"" sidechain. That means that the value of the token (unit of value, ""coin"") of the Rootstock blockchain is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin's value (1 RSKBTC = 1 BTC). ,How does this work? Well, first for every token created in the RSK blockchain a Bitcoin is ""frozen"" on the main Bitcoin blockchain. That means that they cannot be moved or used while they are frozen. So there are never more RSK tokens than frozen Bitcoins - the Bitcoins are ""backing"" the RSK tokens. This way, you can transfer Bitcoins easily to the RSK blockchain.,The trickier part is the other way around - ""redeem"" RSK tokens for Bitcoins. That is an important mechanism for the peg to work, because it ensures that you get a Bitcoin for a RSK token every time you need it.,For this to work, the RSK coins must be ""burnt"" or destroyed and the account who ""froze"" the Bitcoins on the main chain then can ""liberate"" the Bitcoins again. You destroy a RSK token and get a Bitcoin from this account.,This is not possible in a decentralized way still (there is a Bitcoin ""opcode"" or ""command"" missing), so RSK's strategy for their first release is to have a ""consortium"" of different organizations controlling that Bitcoin account that ""freezes"" and ""unfreezes"" the Bitcoins that are transfered to and from the RSK sidechain. These organizations then decide to ""unfreeze"" the Bitcoins if they detect the RSK tokens have been burnt.,(I hope that was simple enough and reasonably correct.)"

Or if you are using a service like an exchange and that exchange decides to accept the RSK coins, you can benefit from it swapping your coins to the sidechain.,Obviously, you will have to run a modified client.,But if Rootstock coins are not accepted by major exchanges, merchants and payment processors, then the use cases are limited. You could experiment with the smart contract feature and port Ethereum Dapps to RSK, but that is more a thing for businesses. We'll see. As a regular Bitcoin user, however, obviously you could then invest in these new dapps/Daos/whatever."

Online casinos do the same.,The only way I can imagine Kim Dotcom will make a popular site, is this:,-You deposit Bitcoins (say 0.1 ,),-You get access to a huge database of encrypted movies in such a way that nobody can see what you download,-You pay a small amount for every download, using your balance on the site.,But I doubt authorities would let this slide, so I still think it's mainly a hype.

We are hoping that soon other states would also welcome Bitcoin this way.

pinkflower,#14,Re: The easiest way to buy Bitcoin using credit card?,"March 04, 2017, 02:48:24 PM",My suggestion would be to find out if your credit card allows you to withdraw cash from an ATM. Some credit card issuers allow this but you pay interest of course just like a loan. You can then use the cash and make a deposit in an exchange and buy BTC at a better rate.

Impossible to work out what is acceptable?,"February 28, 2017, 11:15:45 PM","Hey guys,,I understand that TX fees are part of the BTC universe and that's all good, but I've run into a few issues the past few days and I just don't know how to move forward.,I use Multibit HD as my BTC wallet and it lets you select the fee per byte with a slider, but this doesn't always work.,For example :,TX #1 - 0.2 BTC / 140000 fee - first confirmation in less than 5 minutes - great ,TX #2 (sent about 15 minutes after the #1) - 0.2 BTC / 140000 fee - took over 36 hours to get the first confirmation - wtf?,Then today I sent a much smaller one :,0.019 BTC / 180000 fee (just to be safe after what happened before) - 12 hours later still no confirmations???,Is this an issue with Multibit or am I just being super unlucky here?,I also read that if you have a lot of dust payments (cloud mining payments in my case - I know don't start, I learned the hard way) coming into your wallet this can end up costing you a lot more in fees when you try to send it as a single bigger amount. That's fine but how on Earth am I ever supposed to account for that when setting a TX fee? ,e.g : If I have say 5 x 0.1 BTC payments and a hundred 0.001 payments in my wallet and then try to send 0.2 BTC how do I know which actual BTC it's going to try and send? (2 of the 0.1 amounts or hundreds of the 0.001 ones?).,Or have I got the whole thing arse over tit?,It's very confusing. ,If anybody could shed some light I would really appreciate it."

Xester,#32,Re: Love Fast BTC today!,"February 10, 2017, 12:37:43 PM",It was probably due to small bitcoin transaction activities that occurred just recently. When the price of bitcoin dropped the bitcoin users have temporarily stopped doing transactions and they will resume again when bitcoin will reach 1000$ again. Presumably the are just holding their coins before they dispose or use them and when that time happens the transaction volume will reach climax again driving confirmation to be slow again.

Wind_FURY,#8,Re: Really no talk of segwit / big blocks..,"January 11, 2017, 03:04:55 AM",Here are my thoughts on why most of the core developers want to increase the blocksize to 2mb after SegWit activation. To avoid a bottleneck for the closing of channels in the Lightning Network. Imagine we still have 1mb blocks and have hundreds of LN channels closed at the same time on a regular basis. This could cause those transactions back onchain to be stuck and the mempool would go higher than we have seen before.

Phone companies are especially vulnerable to social engineering. It has happened to various other people, including linustechtips and even cloudflare's CEO.,The services are vulnerable too. 2FA isn't safe if you use it with your phone number. ,Hackers are likely more interested with the people holding a larger amount.,It's weird if a friend asks you for a loan over the phone. Anyone receiving such a request SHOULD verify it physically, especially if its for a large amount.,For the banks I use, the bank account have physical OTP keys and they are much more difficult to compromise.,Bitcoins aren't vulnerable if you choose to secure your coins with a desktop/cold wallet. The reason why Bitcoins are lost through this is because of people storing them in services."

I already upgraded my node to 0.13.1 and given the adoption rate by other nodes, support is strong.,So I'm free of doubts and I'm confident that we will see SegWit activation by end of this year.

Do you think it would be easy to search for a certain address that you want to hack in that big database? No. I think it would take years or even decades before you can even hack a Bitcoin address using that database unless you got lucky and found the address that you were looking for at the top part of that list.,Maybe if someone designs a killer searching algorithm that will let you go through that much number in such short period of time, then we're all doomed."

If you want to hide the fact that you are storing private keys on a machine from someone who is not too much intent on finding them, then it's useful. Otherwise it's not.  For example, a security agent at the border which decides to do a ""random"" Check of your laptop will probably not find anything. If there was a ""tip off"" on you - then they probably will. ,Another note: these methods are typically very sensitive to any change in the image such as rescaling, change of resolution, not to mention printing/ scanning etc. Be careful and check in advance how much destortion the steganographic method is designed to handle (typically - no distortion). ,The above are just general considerations, I didn't check which methods OP used.

RealBitcoin,#1,The Blocksize Debate & Concerns,,"Hello, I've been in bitcoin for 3+ years now and I would like to share my intellectual opinion about big blocks for bitcoin (2mb ,8mb ,etc) , the Bitcoin Hardfork, and about bitcoin in general and what are the concerns we need to watch out for.,Now there have been many shills, from both sides, so to just clear that out, so I want rational arguments pro/contra big blocks and hardforking bitcoin. I am personally anti-hardfork and therefore anti-big blocks, and I will demonstrate here why it is the best choice in my opinion. So stop shilling, and let's start debating this like civilized adults. I`ll present here my arguments and then you guys can respond to it. The thread will not be moderated so that I should not be accused as a shill. But I hope troll posts or low intellect posts (usually 1 liners) will be removed by forum moderators. ,The bitcoin protocol is like a constitution, once you start making changes in it, you will pretty much find yourself in financial tyranny, abuse of power and corruption pretty soon. Whenever things can be changed easily, they will. If there is no resistance to change, they will always happen. Therefore if the bitcoin protocol gets changed only by a small amount, some people will abuse that opportunity, and gradually add more changes, until bitcoin goes off it's original mission, and becomes centralized. Weather that be some sort of filter/blacklist/censoring system, or some sort of other oppressive patch installed into bitcoin. And then bitcoin will fail.,Of course like any constitution, changes have to happen eventually. You can't have the barbarian constitutions of the middle ages rule modern society, even if in the middle ages that was the sacred norm. Changes have to happen eventually, it is inevitable, but it has to be natural, well thought of, and based on real evidence and many many testing.,So in my opinion any change should be at least 1 generational. You don't want to change bitcoin too fast, when it's not even adopted yet by many people. Industry and tech changes too fast nowadays, but you have to slow down so that the clients can catch up. Hard fork is definitely not necessary right now (nor I think it will be in the foreseeable future), because I fear the community is still too young and prone to manipulation, therefore using this 'ring of power' is not an option.,Segwit is good and necessary to fix fungibility and malleability. As a side-effect, it grows the block capacity as well. It is a temporary solution in terms of scaling the block capacity, because that is not it's goal. It's goal was only to fix malleability, which it probably will to some degree. ,This is the path of scaling the Core team choose. And I think it's a very elegant, decentralized approach to scaling. It is one way of doing it, and it's the most easy, immediate and fair way of doing it. Not to mention it's the most secure.,It's not a giant blob of code like ETH+ smart contracts, it's actually isolated from the bitcoin protocol. Security is only good if 1 sector is isolated from another. Think of it as a submarine, if the compartments are not isolated, then if it's breached, the water will sink the entire sub.,From transaction perspective, it can scale bitcoin really bigtime, while adding little or no centralization to the approach. Other 'classical' way would be to add an intermediary to issue IOU bitcoins that could be traded offchain. Well we know that is not an option for decentralization, so the LN is really cutting edge innovation, with little nor no centralization costs to the community.,The transactions will be instant, decentralized or semi-decentralized if you don't host the node, and would be the optimal choice given the current circumstances.,Therefore it is good to have this elegant, secure, and innovative approach to scaling. It also enables new features to bitcoin, that can be used to expand business, economy and other functions.,It is truly a piece of software art, truly crafted by the smartest people on the planet.,Well if the hardfork is really a 100% urgency like if ECDSA gets broken, then it's an urgency, and unfortunately it will have to be implemented. People will not like it, but it will be a true emergency so they will have no choice. However the probability of this is very low.,The more worrysome would be, once the devs have tasted the power of hardfork, then what? What classifies as an urgency? Can they just roll out hardfork every week when an 'urgency' becomes available? We go back to point 1), and how if things get too crazy, it can end bitcoin.,These have to be answered, and the community should always be skeptical.,I hear this argument many times, and it's mostly fearmongering. What if quantum computers become reality they can break bitcoin...?,Well I personally don't believe in large scale quantum computers, I think they won't ever exist, and there is plenty of evidence that supports this. Yes some laboratory theoretical computers might exist, but there are hard limits of thermodynamics that prevent the existence of large ones.,It's the same nonsense like the free energy advocates that think there is some hidden energy source, when 7th grade physics demonstrates you otherwise.,However classic computers might become one day powerful enough to find some exploit in the crypto algorithms (because brute forcing is obviously nearly-impossible).,And for that we shall react as in point 4). But not sooner than that. Bitcoin doesn't need 'what will happen if' type of patches. Bitcoin doesn't need insurance against alien invasion, we can deal with it, when the threat becomes sizeable.,What if the miners become untrustworthy? Low probability again, or it will be temporary. Game theory proves us that people working for incentives won't do things that will undermine the incentives. Or in other words people don't bit the hand that feeds them. If miners become shady then either they will run out of money before they can do too much evil, or they will become replaced by the honest ones, that would gain more money from mining honestly. Not to mention if they really piss off the community, everyone will just sell their coins and the mining business, as well as bitcoin will be over. If they implement capital controls to slow down the dumping, then the price will crash to 0 because nobody can buy, just as nobody can sell. Etc.. with many more theoretical attacks, but all end in disaster for the attacker.  So a miner betrayal would only be temporary at best. ,So far we have had very honest reputable developers. What if that changes and we get replaced by corrupt ones?,Well it's like the saying goes, what you reap is what you sow. If the bitcoin community is comprised of programmers , IT experts and PC experts, then you will always find the best ones amongst them that can work on the code. If the bitcoin community will be comprised of morons, then bitcoin will end long before that.,So it's more important to keep the community healthy, because the community will supply the developers and bitcoin experts.,Also the bitcoin developers are decentralized, even if the Core team has control over the github depository, everyone can host bitcoin's source code on his server and work on the code.,The enforcing mechanism in bitcoin is the miners ,and I've explained in point 6) why miners are not prone to betrayal. So the devs incentive is to show his talent, get fame, get donations, and get careers. The miners enforce the rules, while the community decides weather they like it or not.,So if a dev becomes corrupt, he will achieve little, but will lose everything , especially his reputation.,Devs might be corrupt, miners might be, but all of them would be temporary issues. What if the community becomes corrupt?,Yes this is one of the most concerning factors, if the old guard leaves or gets bored of bitcoin, and we get replaced by 80 IQ morons , illiterate people, or just simply opportunists that dont care about bitcoin only want quick profit, then what?,Well this is one of the biggest and most realistic threats to bitcoin. If the community is dumb, it can be manipulated, and divided to be controlled. Everyone will just control the community by their own incentives and whoever can fool the most people will have control over bitcoin. It is a scary possibility.,My opinion would be a moderate adoption, with many tutorials for newbies, as teaching newbies about bitcoin and it's values. People need to feel home in bitcoin and appreciate it's qualities.,Also the old guard should never leave, if they do they are pussies, and whatever happens to bitcoin will be partially their fault. So people should educate newbies and teach them why bitcoin is the way to go.,Most bitcoin old guard, as well as new investors, want to save bitcoin for long term, usually in a secure wallet. If you roll out hard fork every year, then they will always have to uppgrade their wallets and work with sensitive information, that would expose them to unnecessary risk.,If they don't they can lose their money. What if they are not announced? What if they don't keep up with bitcoin news? You can't just push changes so fast because people will lose confidence in bitcoin's long term future.,If a person wants to put away for his kid's 18th birthday, and forget about that wallet for many years (but keep the private keys backed up and secure), he doesn't want to always be updated with all fixes and patches.,Even other softwares usually have support for 1 version of their software for many years, so why can't bitcoin be the same? It is, and that is how should it be!,So the SET & FORGET approach that most people feel comfortable with, will be violated, and it will upset many bitcoin whales.,Currently only 37% of the network runs the latest software, which is good, because if a bug gets discovered the other 67% will act as a backbone.,If you want to force a hardfork then everyone has to uppgrade before the grace period runs out, therefore all the network will have the same version. If a bug or malware gets discovered in the hardforked client, then the entire bitcoin network will be destroyed.,Therefore hardforks are ultra vulnerable to 0 day bugs (or undiscovered bugs). Decentralization should mean that you cannot be 100% confident of the developers, because we are all humans and we make mistakes, so even if the devs have checked the code many many times, you can still not risk the network, because  0 day bugs are very frequent, even in huge projects ( *cought* Ethereum *cought*)"

If a bug or malware gets discovered in the hardforked client, then the entire bitcoin network will be destroyed.,Therefore hardforks are ultra vulnerable to 0 day bugs (or undiscovered bugs). Decentralization should mean that you cannot be 100% confident of the developers, because we are all humans and we make mistakes, so even if the devs have checked the code many many times, you can still not risk the network, because  0 day bugs are very frequent, even in huge projects ( *cought* Ethereum *cought*)"

I hope they do not.,Since we live in a physical world, with computers made of matter and run on energy there will be limits. We should make the system as _efficient_ as possible because, in a physical world, one of the concerns is that there is some inherent trade-off between blockchain load and decentralization. (Note that blockchain load != Bitcoin transactional load, because there are _many_ ways to transact that have reduced blockchain impact.) ... regardless of the capacity level we're at, more efficiency means a better point on that trade-off.,Not screwing up decentralization early in the system's life is a high priority for me: It is utterly integral to the system's value proposition in a way that few other properties are, and every loss of decenteralization we've suffered over the system's life has been used to argue that the next loss isn't a big deal, making progress backwards is hard: The system actually works _better_ in a conventional sense, under typical usage, as it becomes more centralized: Upgrades are faster and easier, total resource costs are lower, behavior is more regular and consistent, some kinds of attacks are less commonly attempted, properties which are socially ""desirable"" but not rational for participants don't get broken as much, etc. Decentralization is also central to other elements that we must improve to preserve Bitcoin's competitiveness as a worldwide, open and politically neutral money-- such as fungiblity.,But even if we imagine that we got near infinite efficiency, would we want near infinite capacity?,Bitcoin's creator proposed that security would be paid for in the future by users bidding for transaction fees. If there were no limit to the supply of capacity, than even a single miner could always make more money by undercutting the market and clearing it*. Difficulty can adapt down, so low fee income can result in security melting away.  This could potentially be avoided by cartel behavior by miners, but having miners collude to censor transactions would be quite harmful... and in the physical world with non-infinite efficiency, avoiding the miners from driving the nodes off the network is already needed.  Does that have to work as a static limit?  No-- and I think some of the flexcap proposals have promise for the future for addressing this point.,Some have proposed that instead of fees security in the future would be provided by altruistic companies donating to miners. The specific mechanisms proposed didn't make much sense-- e.g. they'd pay attackers just as much as honest miners, but that could be fixed... but the whole model of using altruism to pay for a commons has significant limitations, especially in a global anonymous network. We haven't shown altruism of this type to be successful at funding development or helping to preserve the decentralization of mining (e.g. p2pool). I currently see little reason to believe that this could workable alternative to the idea initially laid of of using fees... of course, if you switch it around from altruism to a mandatory tax, you end up with the inflationary model of some altcoins-- and that probably does ""work"", but it's not the economic policy we desire (and, in particular, without a trusted external input to control the inflation rate, it's not clear that it would really work for anyone).,So in the long term part of my concern is avoiding the system drifting into a state where we're all forced to choose between inflation or failure (in which case, a bitcoin that works is better than one that doesn't...).,As far as when, I think we should execute the most extreme caution in incompatible changes in general. If it's really safe and needed we can expect to see broad support... it becomes easier to get there when efforts are made to address the risks, e.g. segwit was a much easier sell because it improved scalablity while at the same time increasing capacity.

The risks are compensated by improvements (both recent ones already done and immediately coming, e.g. libsecp256k1, compactblocks, tens of fold validation speed improvements, smarter relay, better pruning support) along with those in segwit.,I worry a lot that there is a widespread misunderstanding that blocks being ""full"" is bad-- block access is a priority queue based on feerate-- and at a feerate of ~0 there effectively infinite demand (for highly replicated perpetual storage).

One of the biggest problems with hardfork proposals was that they directly fed this path-to-failure, and I worry that the segwit capacity increase may contribute to that too... e.g. that we'll temporarily not be ""full"" and then we'll be hit with piles of constructed ""urgent! crash landing!"" pressure to increase again to prevent ""full"" regardless of the costs.  E.g. a constant cycle of short term panic about an artificial condition pushing the system away from long term survivability.,But on the balance, I think the risks can be handled and the capacity increase will be useful, and the rest of segwit is a fantastic improvement that will set the stage for more improvements to come.

Right now bidi channels are the only way we know of to get to really high total capacity without custodial entities (which I also think should have a place in the Bitcoin future).,Some of the early resource estimates from lightning have already been potentially made obsolete by new inventions. For example, the lightning paper originally needed the ability to have a high peak blocksize in order to get all the world's transactions into it (though such blocks could be 'costly' for miners to build, like flexcap systems) in order to handle the corner case where huge numbers of channels were uncooperative closed all at once and all had to get their closures in before their timeouts expired.

For me it's pretty hard to understand that quite a few people seem to be unable to understand the primary importance of decentralization for Bitcoin being valuable. People, who claim that transaction capacity and fast growth are more important than decentralization do not really get the reason of why Bitcoin came into existence.,Today, you can already do fast, high capacity transactions via centralized electronic payment providers. You don't need Bitcoin for that. A decentralized Bitcoin will never be able to compete with centralized payment solutions in terms of efficiency. And it should not have this goal, because the essential competitive advantage of Bitcoin stems from the fact that in addition to the value-transfer service it provides it represents also a store of value.

Maybe the UK will become the China of Europe and everyone will flock to the Bitcoin community who knows. But the pound has had such a long life that I don't think people will abandon it so easily. Maybe this weakness is just temporary and things will get back in order soon. I don't think Bitcoin is as good as gold because Bitcoin is super volatile and presents a high risk of losing value over time. Just my 2 cents.

Actually this sparked my interest and I did some researching and apparently there is a study that explored how many Bitcoin users there were in the world and in 2014 the number was around 1.3 million Bitcoiners and the projection is to hit 5 million users till 2019. So maybe OP is right to say that there are 2 million users at this moment. I just assumed that the Chinese would use Bitcoin to top-up their phones or something so I just went for that estimate  , Well it looks like Bitcoin is only popular among the miners in China and not the common users."

The thing is ,itcoin is already recognized by many however their still not willing to ditch other things and aren't going to do it in the future as well since their rather have their wealth in more basket, in order to not lose everything if something goes wrong but one thing for sure, the percentage of them holding golds would definitely decrease as we go by and more will invest in ,itcoin in the years to come.

Meni Rosenfeld,#1,Tiebreaking standard using the blockchain?,"October 03, 2014, 08:53:25 AM","The following issue is very general, but to spare you the abstractions I will describe it by way of presenting the situation I have at hand.,We at the Israeli Bitcoin Association will soon have our first elections to our board of directors. Many details are TBD but basically, members get to vote and the directors who received the most votes are chosen.,A problem exists if there are ties. Let's say there are 7 members, and the vote counts from high to low are 66, 55, 45, 36, 28, 15, 15, 15, 10, ... . Then places 6-8 are shared by people who got 15 votes, and the method doesn't determine which 2 of them to admit.,Some voting systems resolve this with an additional tiebreaking voting round, but this creates a lot of overhead and is not mathematically elegant. Game-theoretically, a better way is to randomly choose the winners; but then we have a problem of ensuring the random choice was done fairly.,A natural way to resolve this would be to use the blockchain. Hashes of future blocks are more or less random and not easy to manipulate. So we can announce in advance that ties will be broken based on the hash of the first block with a timestamp of at least Nov 30 2014 00:00:00. However, I don't want to reinvent the specific way to use the hash to make the selection.,So my question is - is there some standard, deterministic way to use the blockchain to resolve ties? Is there some website which gives results based on this standard? If not, how do we go about creating such a standard?,Note that to address the general problem, the method needs to return a permutation - since we have a number of results which a priori are all equivalent, and we would like to order them somehow. So basically, the method will accept a date (or block height) designation, and a list of text items, and return a randomly permuted list of the items. Some ideas I had is to take the block hash modulo n! and choose a result from the n! permutations, ordered lexicographically, based on the result. Or to use the hash as a random seed which is input to a simple permutation-finding program.,Optionally, the standard would allow using the hashes of multiple blocks, to make it harder to mine blocks specifically to manipulate the system."

You may as well invite one of the guys in charge of it to come over for a few beers to learn some more rather than piece it together from a bunch of whiners on Reddit.

bitcoinmarkets,#1,Chinese bitcoin spot exchanges OKCoin and Huobi are faking most trading volume,"March 28, 2016, 04:19:13 PM","may be easier to read web version: ,To most traders it is common knowledge that Chinese exchanges fake their volume, whether it's OkCoin and Huobi's spot or futures exchanges. Here's an example from Huobi to demonstate the absurdity of the fraud they are committing:,On the 1-day candles you see the volume at over 2.2 Million BTC being traded on Huobi.,And here's the same chart for OKCoin:,Oh no! Only 2 million BTC daily volume on OKCoin. They lose the fake volume competition with Huobi , Shame to their family.,Raise your hand if you think OKcoin and Huobi are really trading 4.5 Million bitcoin per day, almost 1/3 of the current supply:,So we don't even need any more information than this to know that they are committing fraud in their trading volume.

gbianchi,#1,[DATA]Exchanges: their way of using a fractional-reserve and generate inflation,,"I often discussed a topic which is generally underrated:,On a daily basis BTC exchanges make several operations: most of them are likely to be outside the BTC Blockchain. ,If you don’t know, the majority of those operations happen on a private account book which will be never shown on the Blockchain.,Let’s take an example to see how a BTC exchange works.,Let’s say I deposited 10 BTC on the Lovely Exchange and my friend Charlie did the same: both the operations are official BTC transaction registered on the Blockchain.,Now, Charlie and I can start trading on the private account book and whatever will do is not registered on the Blockchain but it’s kept inside the exchange.,The Lovely exchange owns our 20 BTC that can theoretically be used on the real Blockchain: until we don’t withdraw those BTC they belong to the exchange unless we decide to take them out. ,But, right now, those BTC can be used on the Blockchain  by the Lovely Exchange.,The value we see on the exchange is a virtual one: so long as Charlie and myself will keep those BTC on the exchange they’re not really ours. The real owner is The Lovely Exchange.,Now, if the Exchange is serious, wise and good enough will keep the 20 BTC there without using them: the day we will want them back we’ll do our withdraw and we’ll ask for them again.,But what if the exchange actually uses those BTC? What happens?,The exchange can start moving them on the Blockchain while Charlie and I keep trading them on the exchange itself. ,This means that 40 BTC are moving: 20 real BTC and 20 virtual ones. What? The BTC can’t double! Can they?,Obviously, this will be the extreme situation but perhaps the Exchange will keep track of customers operations and it will understand that there will always be ,a certain amount of BTC in its hands: this means that is very unlikely that customers BTC will be withdrawn all at the same time. ,Therefore, the exchange will always keep a certain liquidity to honour small/medium sized withdrawals.,To be clear let’s say the exchange will keep the 50% of the BTC deposited.,Banks in the real world work the same way, they never keep all the liquidity in their belly but they have a small portion of the big cake. ,Technically what they use is called Fractional-reserve banking. Laws require they keep at least the 2% of the total amount: again, ,this means that the moment we would all take our money back the system will collapse since that money simply don’t exist in the real world. They are as virtual as our BTC.,What happens is that banks have a 98% of deposits in their hands: they can use that money for basically everything. Our money got multiplied with a magic trick. ,This can happen due to the money multiplier, one of various closely related ratios of commercial bank money to central bank money under a fractional-reserve banking system.,With a fractional-reserve of 2% (like the one banks are using) the money multiplier is 50. This means that the amount of money will be multiplied by 50 compared to initial amount.,With a bigger fractional-reserve, let’s say for example of 50% we’ll get a money multiplier of 2 which is in any case the initial amount doubled.,So, let’s come back to BTC.,It is more than likely that exchanges have the power to decide what to do and how to use this money multiplier mechanism.,If they are savvy they’ll have a fractional-reserve of 100%, meaning that they’ll keep all the BTC deposited ready to give them to customers when they will want their BTC back.,But no one forbid them to use fractional-reserved based policies: if they use a value of 50% they’re going to double the amount of BTC they have because of what we saw before.,Therefore two things must be considered:,Since the majority of BTC transactions happen on a private account book which will be never shown on the Blockchain no one will notice (until a certain point) ,whether or not an exchange is using some fractional-reserve based policies.,At present time there’s no regulation, no transparency whatsoever and in fact no exchange states this on their T&C and none of them admits if they use the money multiplier.,In the end just a practical example:,Let’s suppose that 20% (almost 3.000.000) of all present BTC are deposited on exchanges and that they’re actually using a fractional-reserve value of 50%. ,These 3.000.000 BTC, considering what we explained regarding money multiplier, will become 6.000.000:,3.000.000 of real BTC as they appear in the Blockchain; 3.000.000 in exchanges’ private account books.,Yes, there are more BTC around since they’ve been doubled thanks to that mechanism.,All the value used were just useful to explain what can happen in the BTC exchanges world: we showed that having no regulation and no transparency it might be possible ,that BTC exchanges are creating quite some inflation into the BTC ecosystem by using the means of the fractional-reserve banking.,This phenomenon probably increased BTC liquidity last year: it’s very likely that BTC exchanges started to use that power in order to profit from it. , Are you telling me that BTC Exchanges can do what they want with my BTC and also manipulate the price?, First of all, as we said, they have a huge power which is the possibility of using the money multiplier. ,We don’t know whether or not they’re using it but it’s likely that some of them are taking advantage of it.,The good thing for you is that you have a great power as well: NEVER store your BTC into an exchange. ,Use the exchange only when you really need to change your BTC for something else.,This is the only way to avoid that exchanges will use the money multiplier to double, triple etc. your (our) BTC. ,Of course there are traders out there who will keep their BTC on the exchanges a little longer but for the average ,Joe there’s no need to use an Exchange as a wallet.,This is the reason why we decided to write this guide since we believe that more and more people need to be aware of this very little known phenomenon.,As we see it there’s just a simple rule to follow:,BTC technology grant you the right to be the only responsible for you money, you can really be your own bank. Never use any third party service unless it is really necessary. ,This is the way you’ll contribute the lower the power of these powerful exchanges. ,Don’t let them taking your own rights and don’t let them getting rich with your money., So is it possible to have an open-source exchange?, Yes, it is but it’s more important that this exchange will decentralized as well, therefore it needs to be p2p as the BTC protocol itself since the most important thing, is that it doesn’t have to make someone else’s interest. ,There are some projects out there, have a look,but these projects require time and in the meanwhile we must learn how to live with traditional exchanges., What about exchanges which give interests on BTC deposits? Do they use a fractional reserve system?, That might be the case. They’re buying at a cheap rate the power to use the money multiplier. This is why we must spread this awareness regarding how the exhanges work. ,Being in the BTC world since 2 years and not having heard about this before it’s really a problem. This could be a ticking time bomb for the whole BTC system.,Everyone believes that we have only 13.700.000 BTC available but if what we said it’s true maybe we have way more than that out there.,This also means that exchanges can “create” BTC at a dirty cheap rate that, on the long run, might kill the BTC mining industry., Why do you think this is already happening?, We do not have any proof so far, we can just guess.,We can notice that objective indexes like total addresses, number of active addresses, number of transactions etc. are growing exponentially. ,For example, at the beginning of 2014 there were about 2.400.000 active addresses e now there are more than 4.000.000 (an increase of 70%). ,There’s a need of a huge inflation to balance and surpass in a negative way a phenomenon like this one.,On the other hand, the market is getting more and more liquid. Here on BTCTALK you have a great deal of explanations such as: ,a)miners get their liquidity very soon and therefore they create inflation: but miners can generate no more than a 10% inflation rate per annum (and this is already diminishing);,b) Historical big holders that dump their belongings in a very masochistically way: why they didn’t do that when BTC value was above 1000$? ,c)more and more merchants accept BTC payments (like dell, overstock, Microsoft) and get fresh fiat money straightforward but they don’t produce inflation; ,   it’s true that they raise the circulation speed but that’s not very relevant anyway.,None of the above convince us if tested with data.,The number of BTC exchanges is growing day by day and so it goes for total transaction volumes. The more they are, the more volume the move the greater ,will be their power to use the money multiplier at very low prices and risks. No transparency evidence comes from the BTC exchanges regarding this matter.,All these proofs lead us to suspect the this phenomenon is real and it is already happening. Anyway, even if these proofs were not sufficient, ,no one should leave the power of using the money multiplier to exchanges. Granted that they’re not using it, nothing blocks them to use it at a certain point., You convinced me that this problem is a real one. What can I do to help?, AS we said this is a real problem indeed which is giving already its inflation related problems.

gbianchi,#1,[DATA]Exchanges: their way of using a fractional-reserve and generate inflation,,"I often discussed a topic which is generally underrated:,On a daily basis BTC exchanges make several operations: most of them are likely to be outside the BTC Blockchain. ,If you don’t know, the majority of those operations happen on a private account book which will be never shown on the Blockchain.,Let’s take an example to see how a BTC exchange works.,Let’s say I deposited 10 BTC on the Lovely Exchange and my friend Charlie did the same: both the operations are official BTC transaction registered on the Blockchain.,Now, Charlie and I can start trading on the private account book and whatever will do is not registered on the Blockchain but it’s kept inside the exchange.,The Lovely exchange owns our 20 BTC that can theoretically be used on the real Blockchain: until we don’t withdraw those BTC they belong to the exchange unless we decide to take them out. ,But, right now, those BTC can be used on the Blockchain  by the Lovely Exchange.,The value we see on the exchange is a virtual one: so long as Charlie and myself will keep those BTC on the exchange they’re not really ours. The real owner is The Lovely Exchange.,Now, if the Exchange is serious, wise and good enough will keep the 20 BTC there without using them: the day we will want them back we’ll do our withdraw and we’ll ask for them again.,But what if the exchange actually uses those BTC? What happens?,The exchange can start moving them on the Blockchain while Charlie and I keep trading them on the exchange itself. ,This means that 40 BTC are moving: 20 real BTC and 20 virtual ones. What? The BTC can’t double! Can they?,Obviously, this will be the extreme situation but perhaps the Exchange will keep track of customers operations and it will understand that there will always be ,a certain amount of BTC in its hands: this means that is very unlikely that customers BTC will be withdrawn all at the same time. ,Therefore, the exchange will always keep a certain liquidity to honour small/medium sized withdrawals.,To be clear let’s say the exchange will keep the 50% of the BTC deposited.,Banks in the real world work the same way, they never keep all the liquidity in their belly but they have a small portion of the big cake. ,Technically what they use is called Fractional-reserve banking. Laws require they keep at least the 2% of the total amount: again, ,this means that the moment we would all take our money back the system will collapse since that money simply don’t exist in the real world. They are as virtual as our BTC.,What happens is that banks have a 98% of deposits in their hands: they can use that money for basically everything. Our money got multiplied with a magic trick. ,This can happen due to the money multiplier, one of various closely related ratios of commercial bank money to central bank money under a fractional-reserve banking system.,With a fractional-reserve of 2% (like the one banks are using) the money multiplier is 50. This means that the amount of money will be multiplied by 50 compared to initial amount.,With a bigger fractional-reserve, let’s say for example of 50% we’ll get a money multiplier of 2 which is in any case the initial amount doubled.,So, let’s come back to BTC.,It is more than likely that exchanges have the power to decide what to do and how to use this money multiplier mechanism.,If they are savvy they’ll have a fractional-reserve of 100%, meaning that they’ll keep all the BTC deposited ready to give them to customers when they will want their BTC back.,But no one forbid them to use fractional-reserved based policies: if they use a value of 50% they’re going to double the amount of BTC they have because of what we saw before.,Therefore two things must be considered:,Since the majority of BTC transactions happen on a private account book which will be never shown on the Blockchain no one will notice (until a certain point) ,whether or not an exchange is using some fractional-reserve based policies.,At present time there’s no regulation, no transparency whatsoever and in fact no exchange states this on their T&C and none of them admits if they use the money multiplier.,In the end just a practical example:,Let’s suppose that 20% (almost 3.000.000) of all present BTC are deposited on exchanges and that they’re actually using a fractional-reserve value of 50%. ,These 3.000.000 BTC, considering what we explained regarding money multiplier, will become 6.000.000:,3.000.000 of real BTC as they appear in the Blockchain; 3.000.000 in exchanges’ private account books.,Yes, there are more BTC around since they’ve been doubled thanks to that mechanism.,All the value used were just useful to explain what can happen in the BTC exchanges world: we showed that having no regulation and no transparency it might be possible ,that BTC exchanges are creating quite some inflation into the BTC ecosystem by using the means of the fractional-reserve banking.,This phenomenon probably increased BTC liquidity last year: it’s very likely that BTC exchanges started to use that power in order to profit from it. , Are you telling me that BTC Exchanges can do what they want with my BTC and also manipulate the price?, First of all, as we said, they have a huge power which is the possibility of using the money multiplier. ,We don’t know whether or not they’re using it but it’s likely that some of them are taking advantage of it.,The good thing for you is that you have a great power as well: NEVER store your BTC into an exchange. ,Use the exchange only when you really need to change your BTC for something else.,This is the only way to avoid that exchanges will use the money multiplier to double, triple etc. your (our) BTC. ,Of course there are traders out there who will keep their BTC on the exchanges a little longer but for the average ,Joe there’s no need to use an Exchange as a wallet.,This is the reason why we decided to write this guide since we believe that more and more people need to be aware of this very little known phenomenon.,As we see it there’s just a simple rule to follow:,BTC technology grant you the right to be the only responsible for you money, you can really be your own bank. Never use any third party service unless it is really necessary. ,This is the way you’ll contribute the lower the power of these powerful exchanges. ,Don’t let them taking your own rights and don’t let them getting rich with your money., So is it possible to have an open-source exchange?, Yes, it is but it’s more important that this exchange will decentralized as well, therefore it needs to be p2p as the BTC protocol itself since the most important thing, is that it doesn’t have to make someone else’s interest. ,There are some projects out there, have a look,but these projects require time and in the meanwhile we must learn how to live with traditional exchanges., What about exchanges which give interests on BTC deposits? Do they use a fractional reserve system?, That might be the case. They’re buying at a cheap rate the power to use the money multiplier. This is why we must spread this awareness regarding how the exhanges work. ,Being in the BTC world since 2 years and not having heard about this before it’s really a problem. This could be a ticking time bomb for the whole BTC system.,Everyone believes that we have only 13.700.000 BTC available but if what we said it’s true maybe we have way more than that out there.,This also means that exchanges can “create” BTC at a dirty cheap rate that, on the long run, might kill the BTC mining industry., Why do you think this is already happening?, We do not have any proof so far, we can just guess.,We can notice that objective indexes like total addresses, number of active addresses, number of transactions etc. are growing exponentially. ,For example, at the beginning of 2014 there were about 2.400.000 active addresses e now there are more than 4.000.000 (an increase of 70%). ,There’s a need of a huge inflation to balance and surpass in a negative way a phenomenon like this one.,On the other hand, the market is getting more and more liquid. Here on BTCTALK you have a great deal of explanations such as: ,a)miners get their liquidity very soon and therefore they create inflation: but miners can generate no more than a 10% inflation rate per annum (and this is already diminishing);,b) Historical big holders that dump their belongings in a very masochistically way: why they didn’t do that when BTC value was above 1000$? ,c)more and more merchants accept BTC payments (like dell, overstock, Microsoft) and get fresh fiat money straightforward but they don’t produce inflation; ,   it’s true that they raise the circulation speed but that’s not very relevant anyway.,None of the above convince us if tested with data.,The number of BTC exchanges is growing day by day and so it goes for total transaction volumes. The more they are, the more volume the move the greater ,will be their power to use the money multiplier at very low prices and risks. No transparency evidence comes from the BTC exchanges regarding this matter.,All these proofs lead us to suspect the this phenomenon is real and it is already happening. Anyway, even if these proofs were not sufficient, ,no one should leave the power of using the money multiplier to exchanges. Granted that they’re not using it, nothing blocks them to use it at a certain point., You convinced me that this problem is a real one. What can I do to help?, AS we said this is a real problem indeed which is giving already its inflation related problems.

Great for international travellers. I gather you can do this already with a mobile, but a card would give Bitcoin much more ease of use for many of the public. It might mean that wallets had to be stored in an alternative blockchain though."

Only the most smarts offer the most easy way for both the parts to have bitcoin: with credit card. Instantly can be made everything. Without any problem from all. Without being obligated to go at the bank, to sign tens of papers etc. That is even my answer. I chose the exchange primarily seeing this option: offer or not bought of bitcoin with credit card.

The way Bitcoin works right now is it is seen more as a commodity (and an unstable one at that) rather than a currency. So merchants still want the business that comes with accepting it as a payment method without the risk of fluctuating value - and so they use Bitpay etc. as a means of getting fiat - while ""accepting"" Bitcoin.

It is however not the communites duty to judge which kind of person someone is nor has anyone here the capacity to do so. The people that constantly give good advice like e.g. DannyHamilton tend to advice in such a way that the user has a wide varity of options and can choose what is best for them. In the end, no one here can do the decision for you we can only show you possible ways.,You sound like you have an agenda which has next to nothing to do with the issue at hand.,No. Any time someone freely makes a light and rushed decision that involves a significant amount of value (regardless whether its BTC, FIAT or another crypto currency) it is their own fault. Bitcoin teaches harsh lessons in that regard as your transaction can rarley be undone.,Mabye thats not where bitcoin is heading?,50 BTC was the mining reward when bitcoin started. I also dont think that anyone can tell how many wallets satoshis has or had, but you are probably refering to addresses.

It is however not the communites duty to judge which kind of person someone is nor has anyone here the capacity to do so. The people that constantly give good advice like e.g. DannyHamilton tend to advice in such a way that the user has a wide varity of options and can choose what is best for them. In the end, no one here can do the decision for you we can only show you possible ways.,You sound like you have an agenda which has next to nothing to do with the issue at hand.,No. Any time someone freely makes a light and rushed decision that involves a significant amount of value (regardless whether its BTC, FIAT or another crypto currency) it is their own fault. Bitcoin teaches harsh lessons in that regard as your transaction can rarley be undone.,Mabye thats not where bitcoin is heading?,50 BTC was the mining reward when bitcoin started. I also dont think that anyone can tell how many wallets satoshis has or had, but you are probably refering to addresses. The point still stands though, test with small amounts until you feel you understand what you are doing well enough."

The only way for me to do anything about it, other than arguing oti, was to switch clients.,Then I read all the bad stuff about Mike and Gavin and what they were doing and I was a bit worried. I read about how they were putting nefarious changes that track IP addresses. Blocking nodes etc,That made me worried too. I don't like creeping censorship as much as the next man so tools that allow it should be regarded with suspicion. Then I read what the change did and saw that it didn't seem (to me) to be half as bad as people were making out.,Then I started to read more about why XT came about I'm not going to link to it all because everyone should do their own research. My understanding though in summary is that the core dev environment seemed to be pretty toxic. This is a pretty bold claim so I started reading through some past posts on the developer list, pull request discssions etc to try and establish how legitimate this claim is. To me it seems to have some legitimacy, but I would encourage you to look for yourselves and see what you feel. I won't post links because I don't want to be accused of leading you.,Now I'm not here to tell you Gavin and Mike are the good guys and core devs are evil. Nor am I here to support those that think XT is the end of times and the core dev team are the knights in shining armour that are going to rescue os from the defilers that sullied out land with a fork. The devil carries a fork. Therefore XT is the work of the devil.,I'm here to say that I think its important that people look around at what is going on and have a real honest think about the situation. Don't believe any of what I wrote above check it all out. Have a look at the pull requests that have been submitted, the discussion that follows. The manifesto posted by XT and the articles written explaining there philosophy. The actions that have been taken by the various participants.,When I did that I found that I no longer supported XT for the block size limit upgrade, but I supported it because it felt like it was right that there should be diversity in clients.

I'll try to answer, but whoever knows sidechain technical details better (and epecially whoever knows the future ,) is welcome to correct me.,0) Sidecoins are not IOUs. They are bona fide coins, just like bitcoins. I would compare them with dollars of different denominations. Like 100$ bills vs quarters coins, they are different, but they are both dollars. Bills are more convenient for big purchases, coins are more convenient for micro-transactions ,, but both are basically the same and can always be converted to each other, at 1:1 rate.,1) If there is no bugs in the cryptocode, stealing parked bitcoins without parking corresponding sidecoins must be impossible. The same about breaking 1:1 ratio. (I use 1:1 for simplicity,,the original ratio could be any. Like ratio of changing quarters for 100$ bills is not 1:1, but 1:400. What matters is that you can return it back at exactly the same ratio).,2) If I understand it correctly, no second party required for (un)parking. Converting bitcoins to sidecoins and back is basically sending them to some special addresses, that is, not much different from moving your bitcoin between two your addresses. How the network would handle it depends on network. If you are using the network for purchases several times a day then using it one more time to park all out should be no problem (the network doesn't care how much you are transferring, 0.1c or 1M$, the load is the same). However, it there is ""main"" blockchain that have to be used for unparking and if it that can handle only, say, one transaction per person per year, then congestion may happen. It would be good business opportunity for aggregation services although. Anyone can offer it: ""send your sidecoin and I transfer it to any other sidecoin within an hour"". Even at 7 transactions per second, there is 25,000 time slots in an hour, so 25,000 competing companies can offer such a service. With such level of competition, prices won't be too high. , ,3) The government is the permanent threat, with or without sidechains. , Yes, sidechain will make creating NSA-coin or IRS-coin much easier.

Tip me registering for a free Bitcoin wallet!"". Then the reader registers, reads some ads, and gets perhaps 2000 satoshis to tip. ,Could be cool... I think"

RustyNomad,#15,Re: New ideas !!!!,"August 21, 2015, 09:46:35 PM","This is actually a very good idea. It will solve so many problems like for example expensive roaming charges. I travel quite a bit and whenever I land in a new country the first thing I do is purchase a prepaid card so that I can use data on my phone while in the country and to be able to phone home. To do so on my existing will be way too expensive due to the international roaming charges which can run into the hundreds or even thousands after just a week or two.,With your model in place it does not matter where in the world I go. No need to buy any prepaid cards.Just take your phone out, it connects to the nearest tower, establish one or other 'handshake' procedure and or setup, you make a call or use data and as you terminate your connection a micro transaction takes place from the linked wallet on your phone for the time/data you used on that tower. No roaming charges to worry about and no need to be in an area where your service provider have coverage. You can just link to the nearest tower.,And as you mention, these towers could be 'privatised' so that the owner gets a share of the income generated from it. I know one of the major 'headaches' for mobile providers is the maintenance and security aspects of these towers. This will no longer be such a headache when the towers are semi-privatised."

After WW2 there was the greatest period of prosperity in the history of US. And no, bitcoin can't end wars more like cause additional ones."

The buying and selling of accounts is not that common, I doubt there's more than a few thousands accounts for sale (if even that). Also selling accounts just means that the account has a new owner, I'd imagine newcomers to be the ones most likely to buy accounts so they can join campaigns. I don't think there are a lot of veterans buying up tons of accounts for themselves ( there probably are some but I doubt it would be more than 100). Bitcointalk is certainly one of the most popular crypto forum but there are plenty more people out there that use BTC/crypto. I myself started out on Reddit and was using crypto for quite a few months before I joined the forum here. Reddit has a pretty huge crypto crowd too and a lot of the people there don't have accounts here."

There are only ~15 million bitcoins that have been mined, with less than that in circulation due to lost coins, burned coins, satoshis abandoned million, etc.,If each person held one BTC the price would be more than the current $280 each and the interest in BTC would be skyrocketing. Considering the fact that we know of several people who control 1,000's of BTC, if not millions, we could dilute the needed amount to be considered a Bitcoin user to say possessing .25 BTC. I think even using this lowered criteria it would be a stretch to say there are 10 million users. I think the 250,000 figure is pretty accurate if we stick with people who either hold or at least use .25 BTC or more routinely. ,I suppose if one were to count total addresses, etc. there would be maybe a million people or so, but is it fair to count someone as an ""user"" who maybe created an online wallet, had some dust deposited and never touched it again? You can argue over the exact amount needed to be counted, even drop to say .1 BTC or roughly $28, but again I can not see a significant increase.,As far as the 500,000 BCT Forum users, as pointed out by others this I am sure can be deflated to probably 200,000 or less unique people. The one pumper dude was recently found to have over 100 accounts by himself, so it is not unheard of to have multiple accounts. With signature campaigns, shills, countless other reasons, I am sure having multiple BCT accounts is more common than not. Say the average was maybe 3 accounts per user, this would put BCT user-base at ~175,000 users. The Reddit accounts, mentioned elsewhere, would mostly contain duplicate BCT users, so the additional unique users would be almost negligible, so even giving lots of benefit of the doubt, I could see the 250,000 users figure as pretty spot on."

I've been involved in the arts all my life and seen plenty of barter and trade takes place. many artists prefer to work outside the system. accepting btc is akin to saying ""I only accept rupee for my art"" it is just one of a panoply of currencies available.,ascribe.io however is a much different thing. ascribe.io is a blockchain based verification of authenticity, provenance and ownership. it is especially useful for selling limited editions, something that is common with photo-work.,i wish the artist luck with her show, and the work is nice too, but i urge her to look into ascribe.io. she wont be the first to sell her work using it but i think she will still be a trailblazer. she isn't the first to offer her work for btc anyway. might as well use the tech to do something fiat cant do....

bitbets,#1,"Move Bitcoin Decimal Place To The Right, and what is mbtc?","April 21, 2015, 05:21:54 AM","Since getting into bitcoin, I have sometimes thought bitcoin might do well to move the decimal place to the right. But people on these forums said it was too hard to do this in the bitcoin code.,It seemed especially relevant, about the time when bitcoin was rising to over $1000 in 2013.,At that time, it seems there wasn't any plans to move the decimal point to the right.,And I remember some people were mentioning the concept of the mbtc.,And they were implying that the concept of the mbtc was really easy or simple, ,as though because they think it was simple, therefore no need at all to move the decimal place.,But I can't remember what the mbtc is.,Maybe someone can tell me what a mbtc is, to clear this up.,Is it the 2nd or 3rd place to the right of the bitcoin decimal point?,Thank you,bitbets"

Among the advantages, it made sure that recreational drugs such as cannabis can be bought by ordinary users, who don't need to risk their lives and savings by approaching criminal drug peddlers for the same. Many of the organized drug trafficking cartels saw their profits dwindle. Once the market place was closed down, Silk Road 2.0 rapidly filled the gap.

I never said that the app itself compromises privacy. ,That 'if you're not a criminal..' is the worst argument. How about I put cams in your home and watch you 24/7, after all you don't have to worry since you're not a criminal?  ,This might be a bit off-topic (we need to stop). ,Anyhow, I've already stated that the app is useful for people who have a lot of followers on various social networks. Those that don't can find better ways to earn money around here (even by just learning simple languages like HTML, CSS..)."

The most obvious is if the app you're using is a photo-based app like Instagram. Without access to the camera, the app can't do anything with your pictures, in the case of WhatsApp, this to allow you to take pictures from inside the app and send photos to your friends. And without access to your photo folder or camera roll, these apps can't save those photos for you either., about scanning apps (for barcodes) like the Bitcoin app wallets, so according to you nobody should download Smartphone Bitcoin wallet apps because the cam could watch your home 24/7 lol.,Let say microphone permission, you probably would think its the greenlight to eavesdrop on all of your conversations. Think about the basic features of the app you're using. Is there an option to record audio? Send voice memos? Shazam, which identifies songs playing around you, would necessarily have to access your microphone to work."

Eg. Which blocks? Or at minimum, which op_returns to combine in which order.,At 40 bytes each, that is 125,000 transaction - ordered, one per block.  Then you'd just need to know the address to reassemble.  It might take 250,000-500,000 blocks since you wouldn't want to do them out of order, so they'd have to be spaced out to avoid orphan out of order issues. And you run the risk of op_return going away later.  edit:  If you waited every 6 blocks to submit a transaction (even assuming it is mined in the next block) that is 24 per day or 5000 days total to encode it, about 13.6 years."

Rassah,#17,Re: Why Do People Believe Bitcoin Will Replace Fiat?,"August 25, 2014, 02:34:55 PM","It's really just a simple waiting game. There is a strong need for a world reserve currency (currently filled by USD, and somewhat my EUR). Fiat currencies have a 100% failure rate, and an average life expectancy of 27 years. Even USD we use today is only about 45 years old, since it switched from being a gold-backed currency to free floating fiat in 1971. So as long as you believe that bitcoin, being an open-source free-to-innovate platform, can continue to exist and be innovated on top of, it should simply outlast all other fiat currencies one by one, with the countries of those failed currencies adopting both bitcoin and the last world reserve currency. If USD collapses within a few short years, with bitcoin adoption still being low those countries will adopt both bitcoin and EUR. If USD lasts for a few more decades, most countries will probably end up using USD and BTC already, and will switch exclusively to BTC as soon as USD dies. At that point, BTC will have completely replaced all fiat.,There's also the black hole fiat collapse scenario, where if bitcoin gains about 50% of world-wide adoption, where it will not make a difference for a merchant or person whether he receives USD or BTC, at that point BTC's technological advantages over USD will kick in full force, people will start preferring BTC, and as a result, the balance of use will tip greatly in BTC's favor. This also means that with more and more people choosing to take BTC, BTC adoption and price will suddenly skyrocket, people will start dumping dollars to switch to BTC, which will make BTC price go up even faster, which will cause more people to switch, over and over in a self feeding cycle, with BTC literally sucking out all the wealth from the USD in a very short period of time. The 50% adoption rate is the ""event horizon"" in this black hole scenario, and if this happens, it will happen VERY suddenly and VERY quickly, likely causing a whole lot of damage to people too slow to keep up in the process.,As Andreas says, Bitcoin's political cause is neutrality, while the world's political cause is SEVERELY skewed to the side. So, in that kind of a world, just being neutral seems like being politically radical. Kind of like just being neutral to everyone and treating everyone equally was a radical political stance at a time when some people were slaves."

I'm fairly confident that he has been doing some freelance programming to help his family out but that is good! would be a shame to wast such a good developer. It's often the case that nerdy/tec youtube channels have younger audiences and I believe this is very beneficial for bitcoin users. Younger folk are more open to new ideas because they have not yet been stuck with the old ones. I hope that Jerry brings out more content informing people about bitcoin in simple terms like this video does.

deluxeCITY,#9,Re: Anyone Else Noticing This,"December 16, 2014, 01:24:53 AM",It is because the difficulty is decreasing while there has been a record number of transactions recently. This results in less supply of block space (as blocks are being found somewhat less often) and more demand for block space (higher transaction volume). This will result in the overall time to confirm transactions (measured in terms of number of blocks found since a TX was pushed to the network) to increase and the average TX fee required to get a transaction to confirm quickly to increase as well

I tried to go to the Coinbase office and found an apartment building, not commercially zoned, next to the Caltrain station. ,You would need relationships for large buys. If you could set up a few relationships with major holders like some of the exchanges you could do fast (possibly not instant) sells of a large quantities. Remember, many exchanges of btc are off book so you wouldn't necessarily see them for sale.,Great question by the way."

Say you start small with $5,000 and 200 bitcoins. You offer them both at the going rate and charge a commission (~1%) per trade.,Imagine your first customer comes in and wants to buy 10 bitcoins. He buys into your 200 and adds to the $5,000. You can have the prices of each of your coins/dollars move up and down so that nobody will buy up one or the other of your initial coins. As you get more customers they will set their bids and sell orders as they like.,I have traded on a few small exchanges. You don't go on those to buy 20k bitcoins because you would pay too much. You usually buy or sell 1 or 2 coins at a time and wait for the market to adjust back to the point that you can buy or sell some more. It's not as fluid as the bigger exchanges but the bigger exchanges started small too."

The only way that the network would lose percentages of hashing powers would be if BTC Guild operated their own mining equipment and then chose to shut this down. Otherwise members will only switch to other mining pools.,However, I think they're giving up too easily in this case. If they're profitable, and have amassed some funds, the first thing I would've done if I was them, if they truly believe in the concept of bitcoin, and are not just into it to make money, would be to move operations abroad. They have all the source code and knowledge, so they could establish themselves offshore, and in addition it would be possible to renounce their US citizenship to make their stance.,There's always the negative and positive consequences of every action, and if they chose to give in now, one can only assume that they chose that option, because it's the option that they think is best for them.,In my view however, although I don't at all like the regulatory environment that seems to become a reality, it's not the regulations that is shutting them down, but rather they're shutting themselves down because they can't or are unwilling to adapt to the new reality.,Heck, surely, if I personally had funds to set up shop offshore, and had to leave my current country because of regulatory uncertainty, I would do so in a heartbeat. However, if I did not believe so much in Bitcoin, I would rather shut it down and jump into any other business where I could make money.,As it's hard to know all the reasons why BTC Guild is deciding to shut down, pointing to the govt. and saying it's their fault we need to stop our business operations, is in my view giving up a little bit too easy.

Since X amount of bitcoins were burned and there is a fixed amount of XCP it can't be converted back? Can't a sidechain be implemented that has the same technology as XCP but utilizes bitcoin? The only difference would be that the amount on that sidechain wouldn't be fixed but instead still tied to the value of bitcoin.

Of course, then he is the accuser, and can't act as an attorney.,3. Don't represent yourself. Don't let anyone represent you. Rather, be a man or woman and PRESENT yourself.

They can accuse you of doing all kinds of things against a statute, and they may be absolutely right, but if there is no harm or damage, and if your name isn't listed and you haven't signed as a party to the statute, you win, they lose.,7. Go after them for money for filing a false claim against you.,This is American common law. It isn't English common law. English common law is a little more straight forward in some ways.

Pagliaro, the site you gave didn't have the whole case, at least not that I could see. In cases, there are often many ""holdings"" that have little to do with the particular case, yet they form precedence. The holding I listed above, is in the actual T. v. P. case judgment rendering by the judge. Find it and you will see."

Notice I said most, not all Android phones. Major retailers don't like you not having the actual card for them to verify. But with the publicity of Apple Pay I'm sure they will have a better attitude about using the NFC for your credit/debit purchases.. I really don't use it much anymore since the gyft app came out, I pay with bitcoin through it and my Android Bitcoin Wallet for most everything using my phone(except petroleum & groceries that I still use NFC phone transactions). I'm sure the new iPhone will be nice. The NFC is fun to play with for awhile and that choice of the larger screen and longer battery life seems great.

Elwar,#1,Bitcoin is like the electric car,,"Bitcoin is much like the electric car, if all cars were electric there would not be as much reliance upon foreign oil, wars over oil would dry up, oil companies would not be as powerful as they are, people who produce their own electricity would not be reliant upon an outside entity for their transportation, etc...,In theory it is nice but then the reality of it comes in. There is no national infrastructure in place to charge electric cars, people are used to gas vehicles and are not willing to switch over mainly because everything is set up for gas cars.,I was involved in the electric car community in the late 90s and it was much like the early days of Bitcoin. People converting their cars to electric, complaining about the big companies ignoring the benefits, trying to figure out the chicken and egg problem of getting charging stations up all over the place to charge non-existent electric cars that weren't being created because there aren't charging stations all over the place.,Then the hybrids started using some of the electric car technology. They tried to make it as close to a gas car as they could, hiding as much of the electric aspect from the user as they could since that is what they were familiar with. Prius used it to get better gas mileage using recharging brakes and the efficiency of the electric motor at low speeds and quick acceleration. The first ones took some time for people to get used to, there was a distrust of electric cars and a knowledge gap. Some hard core enthusiasts added more batteries and converted the Prius into a plug in hybrid showing Toyota how it could be done, begging for them to implement the plug in aspect so you could drive short distances without the need for gas. The first plug in vehicles were confusing to most consumers, die hard electric people were enthusiastic, commercials had to be made to show that it was simple and not all electric (only optional).,Tesla used the concept of focusing on a community that would be willing to adopt a fully electric car while making it cool, they went after the sports car industry where people are willing to put up with some mechanical issues or comfort for something that's fast, looks good and is new. They used the initially high priced vehicles to fund their more consumer oriented vehicles and have been working to put the infrastructure in place for electric vehicles across the country. This should make it easier for future electric car adoption and allow for more companies to start putting out fully electric cars.,Bitcoin is in the early stages of the hybrid phase. Companies are willing to use the good parts of it to help their fiat business, trying not to scare their consumers with the technological aspects of Bitcoin that they may be afraid of. The hybridization is not the most efficient and does not use the full utility of Bitcoin but is what the consumer is currently willing to accept.,We need a Tesla equivalent that can focus on a small focused part of the economy that is most willing to use it and make it look cool and then turn around and use that to grow and set up the infrastructure for the pure Bitcoin economy."

I planning to drop 1-2k euros on it for start and reinvest the return. ,What I don't want to deal with is scammers,  I'm seriously sick of these folks. There are bunch of jvs partnerships out there which are beneficial for both the investor and the jv owner but unfortunately there is less trust on the internet especially when people you are investing to are living in other countries.,Obviously I could just buy some btc, sit on it, try to sell it when the price goes up to make couple of bucks but I looking for something more than that. Investing in mining rigs is waste of money, that business only benefits the manufacturers. ,Any ideas are welcome."

zorke,#34,Re: Reuters: Bitcoin gets boost as U.S. watchdog (CFTC) approves first swap,"September 13, 2014, 04:57:34 PM","The person selling the bitcoin would need to put up some kind of collateral to enter into the agreement. As the price is less favorable to the seller, more of the collateral is taken from them. If the level of collateral falls below a certain level then the account would automatically enter into a buy futures transaction to unwind the sell transaction (individual contracts are fungible)"

When they enter into this contract the buyer would now not buy the 1 BTC they would otherwise buy on the spot market. The buyer would still have all the benefits of owing the 1 BTC except for being able to spend it on the network until the contract expires and the 1 btc is delivered
